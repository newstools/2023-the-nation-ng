From Chris Njoku, Owerri  Police in Imo State have reportedly apprehended five armed hoodlums in the house of one Kingsley Uju, a member of the House of Representatives (Oguta/Ohaji-Egbema/Oru West).  Addressing newsmen at the command’s headquarters, Owerri yesterday, Commissioner of Police Mohammed Barde said the men were mercenaries hired to thwart the presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday.  He said the home of the lawmaker, who is contesting reelection under the platform of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) at Umorji, Ohaji/Egbema, was suspected to be used as an operational base for the suspects to disrupt the electoral process.  Barde said: “Acting on credible intelligence that Hon. Kingsley Uju, House member representing Oguta/Ohaji-Egbema/Oru West Federal Constituency at the National Assembly hired mercenaries to heat up the polity and thwart the Presidential and National Assembly elections scheduled for 25th February, 2023 in the state, operatives of the Command’s tactical teams swiftly embarked on a raid exercise on 24/02/2023 at about 20:00 hours in the house of the said Hon Kingsley Uju at Umorji, Ohaji/Egbema, Imo State, heavily suspected to be used as an operational base for the suspected thugs to disrupt the electoral process.”  He said guns, laptop computers and accessories, among others, were recovered from the suspects, adding that they will be charged to court upon completion of investigations.
