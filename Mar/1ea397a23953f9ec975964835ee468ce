A leader of Osun All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ijesa, Tunde Ejoka, was early yesterday killed by suspected political thugs.  Ejoka was killed in his residence in Ijebu-Jesa, headquarters of Ori-Ade Local Government Area of the state, it was said.  Acting chairman of the party, Tajudeen Lawal, in a statement, described the killing as unfortunate and callous, alleging that political thugs loyal to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were responsible for the attack.  Lawal said, PDP thugs threatened Ejoka on the eve of the presidential and National Assembly elections, adding that, “Ejoka was slaughtered…simply because he canvassed a lot of votes for the party over the weekend.”  Police spokesperson Yemisi Opalola said “investigation is ongoing to unravel the circumstance that led to his killing.”  The spokesperson of PDP, Bamiji Oladele, did not take his call when contacted for reaction.
