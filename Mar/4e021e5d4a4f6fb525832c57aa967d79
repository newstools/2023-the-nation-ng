EMMANUEL TV, the broadcasting arm of the Synagogue Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) has marked its 17th anniversary. Commemorating the event Thursday in solemn praise worship and thanksgiving service at its Ikotun-Egbe international headquarters, Pastor Mrs Evelyn TB Joshua, leader of SCOAN thanked God for the life of the founder, God’s General Pastor TB Joshua whom God gave the vision to establish Emmanuel TV. She also expressed gratitude to members and partners all over the world for their steadfastness and commitment to the success of Emmanuel TV which she said had been sustained by love, the greatest Christian virtue. “Emmanuel TV today has become a phenomenon in Christian broadcasting channels all over the world with God’s unquantifiable grace upon it,” she said as she prayed for continued God’s grace, mercy and favour upon them to be more invigorated and rejuvenated for God’s services.
