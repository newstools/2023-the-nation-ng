The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday got  a rare  commendation from the  Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) for what the body of lawyers called  a well conducted presidential election. The association president Yakubu Maikyau scored the commission 80 per cent  for its handling of the election. “I will say that the elections went well. Those who came out were happy to express their franchise,” Maikyau said on Channels Television. He added: There were challenges, definitely. There were some infractions, some of them actually constituted electoral offences but on the whole, I will score INEC as having performed maybe about 78, 80 percent in the delivery of these elections.
