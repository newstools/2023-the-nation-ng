Manchester United came back from a goal down to reach the last 16 of the Europa League and knock out Barcelona. The first leg ended 2-2, but Barcelona went ahead at Old Trafford as Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty after Bruno Fernandes fouled Alejandro Balde. But United equalised early in the second half as Fred finished with a low shot from Fernandesâ€™ pass. Substitute Antony scored a 73rd-minute winner with a low strike from 15 yards out to send United through. The draw for the last 16 takes place on Friday in Nyon, Switzerland at 11:00 GMT and United will face one of the sides that won their Europa League Group. However, teams from the same country cannot play each other in the next round so United will avoid Premier League leaders Arsenal. United will meet one of Fenerbahce (Turkey), Ferencvaros (Hungary), Feyenoord (Netherlands), Freiburg (Germany), Real Betis and Real Sociedad (both Spain) or Union Saint-Gilloise (Belgium).
