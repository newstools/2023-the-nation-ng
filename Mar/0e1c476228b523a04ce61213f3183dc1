Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane is in the frame for a return to the starting line-up in Wednesday’s second leg with Paris Saint-Germain, after manager Julian Nagelsmann on Friday promised “more minutes” for the returning striker. Speaking ahead of today’s Bundesliga clash at Stuttgart, Nagelsmann said Mane will continue his return following three months on the sidelines after a leg injury ruled him out of the World Cup. Nagelsmann suggested that Mane would again feature off the bench against Stuttgart. “He’s making a good impression. We will try and give him more minutes,” said Nagelsmann. “It was a serious injury but his fitness levels are good. Sadio is part of the usual competition for spots.” Nagelsmann said his side needed to “walk the tightrope” with team selections ahead of the “incredibly important game” against PSG while considering their push for domestic honours. Bayern hold a 1-0 advantage ahead of Wednesday’s return Champions League fixture and sit equal on points with Borussia Dortmund in the league.
