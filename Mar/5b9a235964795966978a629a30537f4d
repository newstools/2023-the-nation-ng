The Economic Community of West African States, (ECOWAS) says it will honour President Muhammadu Buhari with an award in recognition of his achievements in the defence and promotion of democracy in the subregion. Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s spokesman in a statement, said the ECOWAS Chairman, Guinea Bissau’s Umaro Embalo, stated this at a bilateral meeting with the Nigerian leader on the sidelines of the ongoing 5th UN Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Doha, Qatar. According to Embalo, the leadership of the subregional body approved the award for the president as he prepares to leave office upon the conclusion of his two-term tenure. He maintained that the president had done more than any other to support democratic governments in West Africa, just as he had done exceptionally well, waging battles against the emergence of non-democratic regimes. For this, according to the ECOWAS Chairman, Buhari will have his name on the ‘Roll of Honour’ in the community’s new headquarters building upon its completion in Abuja. This, he said, would enable future generations of West African citizens to know about the greatness he (Buhari) achieved and to emulate his laudable examples. Buhari welcomed the proposition, stressing that democracy is the best pathway to bringing together diverse people and a dependable vehicle for the achievement of national development.  (NAN)
