Lagos State Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Mrs. Yetunde Arobieke, at the weekend conveyed the approval of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to suspend the launch of NG Cares Social Transfer (DLII.I). She said the suspension was due to the train/bus accident, which occurred last Thursday in Ikeja, where some government officials died and several others were injured.  The commissioner urged beneficiaries of the initiative to join the government “in this period of mourning by saying a prayer for the families and a prayer of mercy and protection for Lagos State.”
