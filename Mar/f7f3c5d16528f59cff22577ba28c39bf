A former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has showered praises on the Yorubas, classifying them as the most accommodating people in Nigeria. Speaking on Lagos, Omokri labelled it the most accommodating place in the country. He argued the Yorubas deserved to be showered with encomiums, noting that most things Lagosians tolerate would not be accepted anywhere else. He tweeted: “The most accommodating people in Nigeria are the Yoruba. The most accommodating place in Nigeria is Lagos. What Lagosians accept will not be accepted anywhere else. And for this the Yoruba deserve kudos not knocks! We all should be like them. #NigerianElections2023 #TableShaker.” The debate on tribal conflicts and bigotry has taken centre stage in major online discourse over the general elections. The ‘face-off’ has been between Igbos and Yorubas over the ownership of Lagos.  Some have said Lagos is at best a no man’s land but certainly not for the Yorubas. Others have insisted it indeed belongs to the Yorubas but Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti recently disapproved of the two ‘claims’, stressing Lagos belongs to Portuguese. He said Lagos was neither for Yorubas nor a no man’s land but a European satellite slave port.
