Popular stand-up comedian Basketmouth has explained why he couldn’t vote during Saturday’s National Assembly and Presidential elections.The humour merchant, who was ‘cancelled’ by the online community for having scheduled shows abroad which collided with the 2023 elections, regretted he couldn’t make it. He wrote on Instagram: “I have always spoken up about the wrongs in this country. It’s quite unfortunate that I missed elections this year.“However, my international shows are planned one year so as to secure the date and venue. To have changed my date on such short notice would have been a logistical hazard not to myself but to the whole crew.
