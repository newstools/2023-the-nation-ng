Former national Under-20 coach, Manu Garba has said that the current crop of Flying Eagles players are not good enough to win the forthcoming 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup to be hosted by Indonesia in May. Coach Ladan Bosso’s boys clinched bronze at the just concluded U-20 African Cup of Nations in Egypt after defeating Tunisia 4-0 in the Third-place play-off on Friday. The team had qualified for the global showpiece after they pipped Uganda 1-0 in the quarterfinals before losing to a spirited Gambian side in the Semis. Incidentally, Manu Garba led the Flying Eagles to their record seventh and last U-20 AFCON title in 2015, defeating host Senegal in Dakar. Speaking on the live radio programme, Football Frenzy, on Nigeria Info FM Abuja on Saturday, Garba, a two-time Under-17 World Cup winning coach, said that the team needs to inject new players, especially in the midfield and attack, for the team to succeed in Indonesia in less than two months’ time. “I followed the team and watched some of their training in Abuja before they departed for Morocco for the final stages of the training before the tournament in Egypt. Going to the World Cup proper, I think the team needs a lot of reinforcement,” Garba said. “A lot of the players need to be dropped by the head coach and technical crew because the Under 20 World Cup is the University of the game where they would see a lot of players from tough leagues across the world. “So the team needs to be reinforced especially in the midfield and attacking department. And the coach needs to liase with other coaches so they can scout the best players to represent us.” Garba also advised the NFF to organise top friendly games with African and other national teams, especially South America and Europe so they can be familiar with their style of play. He also stressed the need for the team to be back in camp in time and avoid the usual distractions like unpaid allowances and bonuses.
