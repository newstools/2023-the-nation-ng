A member of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, Dr. Abiola Oshodi, has said that the pathway to Senator Bola Tinubu’s victory in the February 25th presidential election was unusual. Dr. Oshodi said Tinubu lost in Lagos, Osun and traditional KKK states of Kano, Kaduna and Katsina so that historians could dig in and reanalyze his  unusual pathway to victory . Oshodi, in a statement issued in Akure, assured Nigerians that Tinuby would hit the ground running once his administration is inaugurated on May. He said, “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu campaigned through all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria and that contributed towards his victory. “I look forward to the President elect  being  the father of Nigeria despite political differences and political affiliations even as he addresses and focus on radically reforming and , restructuring Nigeria for the common good as well as begins in earnest the  implementation of the agenda in his renewed hope manifesto. He will definitely hit the ground running.”
