Head Coach Isah Ladan Bosso told thenff.com that the squad’s confidence and go-go spirit is back with the defeat of host nation Egypt on Wednesday, and he expects a strong performance against the southern Africans Mozambique whom they confront at the 22,000-capacity Suez Canal Stadium on Saturday evening. “The win over Egypt has kept the nerves down and the boys can now focus on playing their game; the way we know they can play. We must stamp our authority on the game from the beginning as we have no idea what will happen in the match between Egypt and Senegal. Our fate is in our hands.” Table-toppers Senegal are walking a few inches taller around the Jewel Sport City, having amassed a maximum six points from their two matches and looking forward to taking on the host nation at the Cairo International Stadium on Saturday evening. Both matches kick off simultaneously at 7 pm Egypt time (6 pm Nigeria time). Meanwhile, Nigeria will welcome back Belgium-based forward Ahmed Abdullahi, who was expelled for a second bookable offense in the opening-day defeat to Senegal. Victory over Mozambique will guarantee Nigeria a place in the last eight, and leave them with only that quarter-final headwind to sail into the search FIFA U20 World Cup finals taking place in Indonesia in early summer. One-pointer Egypt can still qualify if they defeat Senegal, but final placement in Group A, as well as the two other groups, will determine the pairings for the quarter-finals.
