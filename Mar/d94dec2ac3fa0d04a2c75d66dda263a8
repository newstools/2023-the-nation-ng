Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele has denied reports of launching fresh plot against the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The Nation reported on Monday that Emefiele launched fresh plot against Tinubu. But Emefiele in a reply described the news as fake. The Governor, in a statement by the Acting Director Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr. Isa Abdulmumin, said: “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been drawn to a story published in The Nation newspaper of Monday, March 13, 2023 edition, alleging that the Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele has launched a “fresh plot against President-elect”. “The aforementioned story went further to allege that the Governor has made a certain amount of money available to a candidate ahead of the March 18, 2023, gubernatorial poll. “We wish to inform members of the public that this story is completely false and malicious as the CBN Governor does not know and has never met or even spoken with Mr. Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, either in person or through a proxy. “We wish to reiterate that the CBN Governor does not take part in politics and therefore urge anyone with contrary information to prove the Governor wrong by providing any facts. “As such, the Governor and his team at the CBN should be allowed to focus on their assigned job with a view to achieving the statutory mandate of the Bank.”
