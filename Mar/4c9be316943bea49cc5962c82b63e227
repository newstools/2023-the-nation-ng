Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah sealing a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain doesn’t look like a deal that makes much sense for a variety of reasons, according to Jonathan Johnson in his exclusive CaughtOffside column. Salah has been linked with PSG recently after being spotted meeting with the Ligue 1 giants’ president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, but Johnson has reassured Reds fan that this doesn’t look like a deal that would be possible for the French champions. The Egypt international is undoubtedly one of the finest attacking players in world football on his day, and could be ideal to replace one of PSG’s front three if they were to leave, but it’s not a typical Luis Campos signing, according to Johnson. The reporter also noted that one issue PSG have at the moment is a need to stay on the right side of Financial Fair Play, and it’s unrealistic they’ll be able to do so if they bring in a big name like Salah alongside Milan Skriniar, who is already set to join from Inter Milan. “Despite rumours to the contrary, I don’t think Mohamed Salah going to PSG this summer is doable,” Johnson said. “The issue PSG have is that would have to sacrifice a big name to fund the deal, and I think we can rule Kylian Mbappe out of that equation – he is PSG’s undoubted star man.
