Novak Djokovic is hoping the Paris 2024 Games will be his most successful Olympics to date, as he continues to chase the gold medal that has so far eluded him. After notching an impressive straight-sets victory over Dutch world number 39 Tallon Griekspoor on Wednesday to reach his 13th  Dubai quarter-final in as many appearances, Djokovic spoke about his ambitions for the Olympic Games next year.  “I hope that I’ll be able to play healthy for next year’s Paris Olympics,” said Djokovic, whose best showing at the Games so far came in 2008 when he won bronze in singles.  “It’s going to be played on clay at Roland Garros, I’m familiar with those grounds, so I hope that the best Olympic result for me will come there.” Two of Djokovic’s 22 Grand Slam titles have come at Roland Garros, in 2016 and 2021. With a far more straightforward display compared to his opening round in Dubai, Djokovic extended his undefeated run this season to 14-0 – and his overall winning streak to 19 matches – with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Griekspoor, who is one of the most improved players on tour these past two months. It was a clean performance from Djokovic, who dropped just two points behind his first serve and fired 29 winners against a mere six unforced errors.  “It’s been a great evening for me tonight. Yesterday I really had to work hard to get a win,” said five-time Dubai champion Djokovic, who squeezed past world No.130 Tomas Machac with a third-set tiebreak victory in the first round.
