Edo Refinery in Ologbo, is operating at 80 per cent capacity and is currently oversubscribed, the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki has said. He spoke during an inspection of the companies operating in the Ologbo axis of the state, including the refinery project and an ethanol production plant, which is currently undergoing construction. Edo Refinery was developed by Edo Refinery and Petrochemical Company Limited (ERPC) with support from the state government through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Speaking to reporters during the visit, the Obaseki said: “You can see that there is production going on at 80 per cent of the plant’s capacity and they have been able to sign a crude oil contract with a private company that is supplying crude to the refinery.  “They are able to sell finished products now as you can see tankers loading. However, they have more demand than they produce. The demand from the local market is far in excess of what they are supplying. So, we need to encourage more people to build more refineries,” he said. He said: “We are encouraging people in the Gelegele axis to also come to invest in the opportunities of the gas there.” You know our government is one that encourages private investment and provides the enabling environment for people to come and invest.” On his part, the Enogie of Ologbo Dukedom, HRH Owen Akenzua commended the governor for his developmental strides, promising to work with the state government to ensure peace and security in the area.
