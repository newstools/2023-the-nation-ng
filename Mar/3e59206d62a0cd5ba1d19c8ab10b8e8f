In the Second Republic, the late former Imo State governor, Chief Sam Mbakwe was nicknamed the weeping Jeremiah of Imo on account of his emotional exhibition each time he felt that things were not going well for his people. Not a few people’s memories of the deceased former governor were rekindled on Thursday as the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi, broke down in tears during a press conference he addressed about his plan to challenge the election of his counterpart in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu‘s election in court. Speaking at the news conference in Abuja, an visibly devastated Obi said his party would follow all available legal and peaceful procedures to reclaim his mandate.
