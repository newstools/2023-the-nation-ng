He said prayers, sustainability of peace and orderliness are weapons to return the country’s lost glory. “As Nigerians prepare for elections  on March 11,  I am calling on Lagosians, and Nigerians to embrace wisdom … “We must eschew violence and assist Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure a transparent and credible exercise because democracy does not express itself through violence…” Babatope, said. He cautioned youths against being used as thugs. “Every youth should vote their conscience in line with democratic principles. You have rights to protect your votes but avoid violence,” the clergyman said.
