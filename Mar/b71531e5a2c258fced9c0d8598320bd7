Cristiano Ronaldo has aided in the effort to help the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, which violently tore apart cities such as Antioquia and Aleppo. The disaster has taken at least 50,000 lives including that of Christian Atsu, former Chelsea and Málaga CF player, as well as Ahmet Eyup Turkaslan, the goalkeeper for Yeni Malatyaspor. According to the Daily Mail, Cristiano Ronaldo has sent an aircraft full of humanitarian aid to the areas most affected by the quake. Specifically, it has sent tents, food parcels, pillows and blankets, beds, baby food, milk and medical supplies to help in the humanitarian effort. It is not the first time that the Portuguese star has expressed solidarity with the Turkish and Syrian cause. Two days after the tragedy, Merih Demiral, the Turkish defender for Atalanta, contacted Cristiano to put his signed shirt up for auction, which the Turk had in his collection.
