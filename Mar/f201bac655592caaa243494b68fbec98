Lekan Osifeso Jr, who is widely referred to as Lojay, has opened up on how his experience on the streets of Lagos inspired his sophomore album entitled Gangster Romantic. In a recent chat, Lojay said when creating the music project, he was coming from a place where he has just gone through several things and he decided to channel it all into the project. “When I was creating the project, it was coming from a place of just having been through stuff in Nigeria, just being through streets of Lagos, especially with everything that’s happened in the last 12, 18 months, and I just wanted to express that,” he began. Continuing, Lojay said “In that time I’ve seen “shege,” and for me to survive the “shege” I’ve understood that I just can’t be a romantic. In order to survive I need to toughen up in these streets and be a gangster a bit. This project is an expression of that, it’s an expression of everything that’s happened in the last 12, 18 months and it’s an expression of where I’m at right now, emotionally.” Lojay became popular after his collaboration with famous music producer Sars on the monster hit song, ‘Monalisa.’ He peaked at number 8 on the billboard U.S. afrobeats songs chart with his song Monalisa, in which he features Chris Brown and Sarz.
