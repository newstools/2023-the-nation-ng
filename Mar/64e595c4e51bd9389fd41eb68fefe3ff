Chrisland School has said they do not plan to exhume the body of Whitney Adeniran, its pupil who died on February 9 during a sports event in Agege. Blessing Adeniran, Whitney’s mother, accused the school of negligence. Lagos State Ministry of Education ordered a temporary closure of the school pending investigation. An autopsy conducted on February 15 showed the girl died from asphyxia and electrocution. State officials raised the alarm that they learned of a dialogue seeking to exhume the body of the girl. Lagos argued that conditions that would warrant this under the Coroner system law do not apply in Whitney’s case. In what appears to be a response to this, Chrisland said it had no plan to exhume Whitney’s body. It added, in a statement to TheCable, that effort was underway to immortalise Whitney’s name in the school. “We vehemently refute the claim making the rounds that Chrisland intends to exhume Whitney’s body,” it said. “We have no such plan and assure the public that we are also parents in mourning and will not do or subscribe to anything that paints such insensitive optics that prevents our dear daughter from resting. “We assure you all that no such thing will happen. Plans are underway to immortalise Whitney’s name so she can remain indelible in our consciousness.” The school, while reacting to the outcome of the autopsy, expressed its remorse about Whitney’s death. “The management of Chrisland School is aware of the developments around the autopsy report,” its statement read. “We are deeply saddened and sorry about Whitney’s death. We are remorseful and sorry to Whitney’s parents. “We are sorry to our parents and the entire community that hosts our school. We are also very sorry to the nation at large. It was a huge loss to the School. “We express an equal measure of apology to the Nigeria Media, another critical stakeholder, in case we have sent unbearably quiet signals.”
