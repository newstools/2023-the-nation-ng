The ADC senatorial candidate for Kwara South Senator Suleiman Ajadi has rejoined the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He announced that he will be working with other progressives to re-elect Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrahman who he said remains the best option for Kwara State for the next four years. In a statement on Tuesday, the senator also said he and his team returned to the APC as he is not given to politics of zero sum and perpetual bitterness. “My supporters and I have put the National Election behind us. We cannot be accused of not exercising our democratic rights. However, it is time to move on as democrats. Consequently, I am hereby directing my supporters to work conscientiously for the re-election of Governor Abdulrazaq who, in all fairness and in the estimation of the overwhelming majority of our people, has done his best within the circumstances of our state to rebuild Kwara State to an enviable height. He is therefore the best man on the ballot for the office of Governor, and I am directing my supporters and the people of our state to support him, ”the statement stated. He added: “I also have the mandate of majority of our candidates, especially those from Kwara South, to announce our return and collapse of our structures into the APC. “Whatever the misgivings anyone may have, i have come to the conclusion that any vote against the Governor at this time would amount to setting our state back several decades. I do not want to be on the wrong side of history, hence my decision to make this public declaration of support for the re-election of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq.”
