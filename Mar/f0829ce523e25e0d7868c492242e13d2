As the ongoing reality TV show, BBTitans enters week eight, Biggie has unpaired the last 12 housemates. After six weeks of being paired – a male and female from two different countries – and playing the game for the sum of over N46 million ($100,000), the show has taken a new dimension. On Monday, March 6, the show’s progenitor introduced another twist to shake up the BBTitans house situated in Johannesburg, South Africa. First, Biggie introduced the ultimate Veto game, which secures a spot in the finale for the winner as well as the position of the Head of House. South African student lawyer and housemate, Ipeleng emerged victorious in the game and became the first housemate of the show to secure a finale ticket. In the same vein, during the nomination process, Biggie jolted the remaining 12 housemates, who went into the Diary Room as pairs but left as individuals, by instructing them to share with one another what they have learned from their partners. This created a sea of tears and emotions were exposed and several housemates shed tears. With barely three more weeks to the end of the show, Ipeleng has emerged as one of the luckiest housemates in the house – having enjoyed the Head of House luxury several times. In the first week, she was chosen as the HoH’s partner, in the second week, she won the Heads of House title with her former partner, BlaqBoi and in the eighth week, she won the HoH title again to secure a spot for herself in the finale. She has also won other cash and product prizes during games and other activities. Other housemates that have won cash prizes include Nigeria’s Marvin, BlaqBoi, and South Africa’s Thabang amongst others. The BBTitans show is scheduled for wrap up on Sunday, April 2 with a grand finale scheduled to hold in the Randburg area of Johannesburg, South Africa.
