The Court of Appeal in Abuja has dismissed an appeal by suspended DCP Abba Kyari in which he sought the reversal of an earlier ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja refusing his request for bail. In a judgment a moment ago, Justice Stephen Adah, who read the unanimous judgment of a three-member panel, held that Kyari’s appeal was without merit. Justice Adah held that in view of the nature of the charges pending against Kyari and others before the trial court, such request for bail needed to be handled with caution. He held that Justice Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court, Abuja, who earlier rejected bail to Kyari, appropriately exercised his discretion in refusing to grant Kyari bail. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is prosecuting Kyari, a former head of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) of the Nigeria Police Force, and four members of the IRT – ACP Sunday J. Ubua, ASP Bawa James, Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu – before a Federal High Court in Abuja.
