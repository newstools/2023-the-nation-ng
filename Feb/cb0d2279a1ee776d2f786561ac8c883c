The new regime, according to the statement, takes effect from Wednesday 1st March, 2023. This follows Nigeria’s recent policy of visa reciprocity with the US. The statement reads: “Effective March 1, 2023, the U.S. Mission will increase visitor visa validity from 24 months to 60 months for Nigerians who want to enter the United States temporarily for business and/or tourism.  “The visa validity extension allows Nigerians to use the visa for 60 months to make short trips to the United States for tourism or business purposes before having to renew their visa.  “The visa application fee, currently USD160, will not increase as a result of the increased visa validity. “Increasing visa validity is one of several initiatives taken by the United States to reduce visa appointment wait times in Nigeria. The U.S. Mission continues to offer No-Interview Visa Renewals to those who meet the eligibility criteria.  Appointments for No-Interview Visa Renewals are readily available.” The statement also listed those eligible for no-interview for visa renewals. Those in category are applicants for a B1/B2, F, M, J (academic only), H, L, or C1/D (combined only) visa.
