Lagos State Council of Tradesmen and Artisans (LACOSTA) has backed the re-election of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat and other All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates for Saturday’s Governorship and House of Assembly elections.  The President, Alhaji Nurudeen Buhari, made this known at the weekend, at a news conference at the headquarters of the association in Shogunle, Lagos.  He said: “The entire members of LACOSTA, who are more than six million, have resolved to once again throw their weight behind the governor-friend of the masses, Mr. Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Dr. Hamzat and all APC House of Assembly candidates in Saturday’s polls. “Let’s do this as payback time for the governor, who has done well for this great state since taking over power four years ago.”  Buhari said LACOSTA would begin house-to-house sensitisation and mobilisation of residents, to enable the governor return to office for second term.
