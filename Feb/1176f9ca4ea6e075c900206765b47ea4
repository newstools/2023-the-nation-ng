The 2023 CAF Confederation Cup CAFCC, group stage enters matchday three this weekend as Nigeria only remaining representative in the competition, Rivers United will be facing daring club Motema Pembe in the first of the double headers between the two sides that will likely make or mar either side progress. Rivers United lost their first away trip in the group to Diables Noirs by 3-0 but only bounced back playing at home when they defeated Asec Mimosa by the same margin to save from pride. The Pride of Rivers needs to be at their best to avoid another defeat on the road in the competition as they will also face DC Motema Pembe on day four on March 8. A minimum of four points for Rivers United over the double headers will surely boost their chances of qualifying from the group as DC Motema would be left with only three points after matchday 4 while Rivers United will be riding on 7 points. They will need a win out of the remaining two matches ( away to Asec Mimosa and at home to Diable Noirs) will berth a quarter-final ticket. But Rivers United is faced with a very difficult opponent in DC Motema Pembe as the Congolese side has proven to be a very difficult opponent to beat. DR Congo is yet to lose any game in 2023, a run that included two draws in the CAF Confederation Cup group stage and four other victories in the domestic competitions played this year.
