Taiwo Mati spent less than 24 hours in Singapore after he was shown the exit in the qualifying round of the WTT Singapore Smash taking place at OCBC Arena in Singapore. The Nigerian who arrived from his base in Portugal early on Tuesday was nowhere near his Ecuadorian opponent in the first round of the qualifying stage. Knowing what awaited him against Alberto Mino of Ecuador, Mati had told NationSport that he had taken time to watch several matches of his opponent to be able to checkmate in the encounter. But it came to naught  against the South American star as Mati failed in his first outing at the Singapore Smash with a 3-0 loss. Despite coming close in the first two games which ended 11-9, 11-9, the third game was mainly dominated by Mino who ended the Nigerian stay at 11-2 in the third game to complete the 3-0 rout and put an end to Mati’s stay in Singapore. A disappointed Mati blamed his defeat on inexperience. “I think he made use of experience against me. I tried my best but my best was not just too good enough and I will surely continue to work harder. My remaining stay in Singapore will be used to watch some of the top players and learn from them,” Mati said. Also, Senegal’s Ibrahima Diaw continued his losing streak on the big stage after the 2020 Tokyo Olympian was defeated by Poland’s Tomas Polansky 3-1 (11-9, 4-11, 11-9, 11-5). Polansky came to the Lion City ranked No.106, 30 places below Diaw, but he looked anything but an underdog out on OCBC Arena. HIs free-flowing play was able to secure him the win, improving on his round 1 exit at the 2022 edition of the event. Africa’s only surviving player in the qualifying round Algeria’s Mehdi BOULOUSSA continued his fine form to book a place in the final stage of the qualifying round with a 3-1 win over Puerto Rico’s Daniel Go
