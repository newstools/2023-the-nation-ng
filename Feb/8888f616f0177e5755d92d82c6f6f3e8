SIR: Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, former vice president and currently, presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is a political opportunist who doesnâ€™t care about the interests of the Nigerian people but himself. When the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) came up with the naira redesign policy, Atiku praised it to high heavens thinking it was designed to stop the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu from emerging victorious at the polls. He even urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele to adhere strictly to the January 31 deadline. When the effects of the policy began to bite hard on Nigerians and the consensus position among the generality of the populace was that there needed to be an extension of the deadline, Atiku shifted his position and joined the bandwagon by urging for a slight extension of the deadline. The CBN extended the deadline till February 10. On February 1, Atiku took another position publicly again urging the CBN not to shift the deadline for the currency swap after February 10. With just a few days to the presidential election, Atiku has again done another volte-face by condemning the naira design policy in a post on his Facebook page. He urged the CBN to allow commercial banks accept the old N500 and N1000 notes and to make the new notes available in sufficient quantities to ease the suffering of the masses. It is evidently clear to all Nigerians that Atiku is a desperate and unprincipled politician who would say anything or adopt any position as long as it confers on him a political advantage. He is a man with weak convictions and weak strength of character who cannot be trusted with the leadership of a diverse and heterogeneous nation like Nigeria.
