Kylie Jenner has lost over one million followers in just a few days over an online rift with Selena over eyebrow. While Disney star becomes the new Queen of Instagram as she gained around 10 million followers, Kylie’s Instagram account saw a massive decline with the follower count slipping from 380 million to 379 million in just a week after her supposed jibe at the former. The drama began on Tuesday, February 21, 2023 when Gomez made fun of her own eyebrows saying she had accidentally over-laminated them in a video posted on her TikTok story. After a few hours, Kylie posting a close-up selfie via her Instagram page with the caption, “This was an accident?” spurred heated reactions among Selena’s followers. Subsequently, on the same day, Hailey Bieber took to her Instagram account to share a facetime screenshot with Kylie, zooming in their perfectly styled eyebrows to the camera.

She wrote: “This is reaching. No shade towards Selena.” After all the farce, Selena decided to take a much-needed break from TikTok and told fans: “I’m 30 and am too old for this. But I love you so much and I’ll see you guys sooner than later. I’m just going to take a break from everything.”
