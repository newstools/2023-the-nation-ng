The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has described the election of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as a vote of confidence in his vision and ability to implement major programmes that would uplift the country. Reacting to the announcement of Tinubu as the winner of the February 25 poll, ACF said the results by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) validated the nationwide acceptance of Tinubu as a detribalised leader. Chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Kano State Chapter, Dr Faruk Umar, congratulated Tinubu on his election. He said: “Your election has demonstrated to the whole world that religion and tribe will no longer play a role in Nigerian politics as your success cut across the regions and religions in the country”. He commended the INEC for its steadfastness and transparency in conducting an election well-acclaimed by local and international observers as free and fair. Umar also praised President Muhammadu Buhari for providing leadership at a critical time and for believing in the sanctity of a free and fair electoral process.
