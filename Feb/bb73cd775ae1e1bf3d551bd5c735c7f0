Actress Kate Henshaw has expressed disappointment over her inability to vote. The respected actress complained the Bimodal Voter Accreditation (BVAS) could not recognise her though her name was on the list and INEC official website. “INEC, I registered, I transferred my card. I picked up my PVC now your BVAS is saying I’m not registered but I have seen my name on the register on the wall and on your website,” Henshaw said in a video shared on social media.
