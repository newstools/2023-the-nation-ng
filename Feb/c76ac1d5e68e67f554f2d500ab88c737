Ahead of the 2023 general election, an incidence tracker technology application has been launched to monitor violence during the poll in states. The tech application which was launched by Brain Builders Youth Development Initiative was said to track violence in Abuja, Lagos, Osun and Kwara states.The Global Director of the initiative, Abideen Olasupo while launching the tech app in Osun disclosed that the state especially Osun has the highest number of political violence noting that over ten people have been killed during the build-up to the election. He stressed that the App can reduce election violence, saying, “We decided to launch the application in Osun due to the statistics available that Osun has the highest political violence in 2022. Our objective is to reduce the act drastically as we believe nobody’s ambition is worth the life of any human. Olasupo explained that It will enable citizens to report cases of electoral violence in real-time, identify potential risks with an incident analysis dashboard, detect early warning signs, inform stakeholders, and generate relevant actionable reports to identify problem areas throughout the electoral cycle and alert relevant security actors.” The chairman of Osun Civil Society Coalition, Waheed Lawal, commended the application and pledged to train civil society groups on its usage to achieve its objectives.
