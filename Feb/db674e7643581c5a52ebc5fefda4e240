President Muhammadu Buhari has hosted the winners of Saturday’s Senate and House of Representatives elections from the Daura zone, his constituency, at his house in Daura, Katsina State. In a statement yesterday in Abuja by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari said: “Respect the voters and make them feel important. If you don’t, they will wait in ambush for you in the next election. Depending on how you deal with them, they will keep you in office, or they will send you packing.” The President congratulated Senator-elect Nasiru Sani of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) who polled 174,062 votes to beat the incumbent and defector to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ahmed Babba Kaita, following his defeat in the primary election. Kaita lost the election with more than 10,000 votes. President Buhari also welcomed the APC House of Representatives member-elect for Daura/Sandamu/Mai Adua Federal Constituency, who defeated his PDP opponent with more than 10,000 votes. The ruling party’s National Legal Adviser, Ahmed El-Marzuq, who led the newly elected representatives, told the President that the party’s good showing was achieved through the progress recorded in the senatorial district under the Buhari presidency. El-Marzuq cited several projects, which he said had enhanced education, entrepreneurship, social development and the development of human capital in the area. The National Legal Adviser presented copies of results to the President. President Buhari received the results full of appreciation.
