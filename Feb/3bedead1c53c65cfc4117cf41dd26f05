Following his brace against Monaco at the weekend, OGC Nice striker Terem Moffi has been listed alongside PSG’s duo of Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe among the French Ligue 1 Team of Week 25 by L’Equipe. The Nigerian was on target twice including an assist for his new French club in their 3-0 bashing of Monaco. Apart from winning the man of the match award, Moffi was awarded top marks for his scintillating performance: “He hasn’t quite looked himself since moving from Lorient registering a couple of anonymous performances. However, he was back to his clinical best against Monaco, scoring with his only two shots in the first half. The first relied on an incredible bit of control from the Nigerian international, who looks to have quickly re-found his scoring touch. Meanwhile, Nice coach Didier Digard has expressed satisfaction over the performance of the 23-year-old against Monaco even as he acknowledged the quality of his new signee from Lorient.
