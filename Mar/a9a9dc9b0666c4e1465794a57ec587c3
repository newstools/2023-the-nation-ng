Senator-elect for Anambra Central, Victor Umeh, has said Anambra State Governor Chukwuma Soludo and his All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) have no moral justification to seek votes for candidates in Saturday’s House of Assembly election. He alleged that Soludo and APGA sabotaged the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi, in the February 25 poll. Umeh was APGA’s national chairman. He defected to the LP after he was denied ticket by the party leadership. Umeh asked Soludo to apologise to the people of the state, Obi, Ndigbo and Nigerians in a state broadcast before asking for their votes. Speaking on a radio programme in Anambra State, the lawmaker said the people had got no reward for voting Soludo as governor, adding that the party did not believe in the treachery for which the new leadership of APGA was known. He described as unnecessary, Soludo’s plea for votes, which he noted was borne of out fear of impeachment. Umeh urged the people to ignore such last minute appeal and vote for LP candidates in Saturday’s election.
