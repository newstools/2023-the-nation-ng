The Osun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned alleged tensed atmosphere under which last Saturday’a presidential and National Assembly elections were conducted in the state. The party decried the pocket of lawlessness, violence and extra-judicial killings that trailed the electoral process in what it called severe heinous attacks on its members across the state before, during and after the polls. Addressing reporters at Tinubu/Shettima Campaign Office yesterday in Osogbo, the state capital, APC’s acting State Chairman Tajudeen Lawal said 15 persons were killed and several others injured in the process. The party rejected the results of the elections in some parts of the state, arguing that they did not reflect the people’s wish. It praised the voters in the state for their unflinching support, resilience, forthrightness and strong resistance in the face of “naked intimidation and physical life-threatening events” from those it called the daredevil elements of the ruling party before, during and after the presidential and National Assembly elections. The APC urged its members to remain calm, assuring them that it would challenge the results of the elections and seek redress through legal means. Lawal said: “The entire structure of the APC and its members in the state were denied a level-play ground to canvass for votes before the elections as it is on record that so many of the party’s members were either killed, maimed, attacked or run out of their abodes by the PDP hoodlums. “The presidential and National Assembly elections of last Saturday were held under a siege with the PDP hoodlums having a field day across the state to the extent that it would be impossible for any political party which is playing by the rules to win the elections against the political vampire called the PDP whose thugs were ready to shed the blood of any strong-headed APC member or supporter.”
