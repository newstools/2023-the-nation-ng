The Special Adviser to Lagos Governor on Drainages Joe Ibokwe has predicted that the President Elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will complete two terms.  He was responding to a troll who challenged him for supporting the re-election of Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo Olu . Igbokwe had written: “President-Elect ASIWAJU BAT is a good friend of the Igbo and he did his best for prominent Igbo businessmen and women in Lagos including me.  “This is payback time and we should do this by voting for GOV SANWO OLU en-mass on March 18.” Replying,  the troll, a certain Ejike wrote: “Dash him your wife and daughters and enthrone him as your family deity. That’ll be adequate payback”. Igbokwe, who was clearly angry over the statement, said Tinubu will return second term and hand over to a northerner because the Igbo race is not playing the right politics.  Read Also : Amaechi more Igbo than Joe Igbokwe – Ohanaeze He said: “When I see the level of despicable abuses and calling of names coming from the South East young people I run away with the thinking that we did not do our duties as parents. Shame has enveloped me from head to toes. “Ejike Akunna jisieike, mark my words here: Asiwaju from 2023 to 2031 and another Northerner from 2031 to 2039. We will still be children of anger and children of hate and life goes on. We will be onlookers because we refused to play politics. Dazzol!!!”
