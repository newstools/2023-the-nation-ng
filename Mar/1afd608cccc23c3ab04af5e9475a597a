The Supreme Court has affirmed the nomination of Senator Rufaâ€™i Hanga as the candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in the February 25 National Assembly election.

The court affirmed the two earlier concurrent judgments by the Federal High Court and Court of Appeal, both in Abuja, in which it was held that Hanga was the candidate of NNPP for the election.
