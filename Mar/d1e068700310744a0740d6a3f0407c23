The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council (APC PCC) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to come up with palliatives that will ameliorate the losses suffered by farmers as a result of the disruptive implementation of cashless policy introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  The Agro Commodities Directorate of the campaign council at the introduction of the monetary policy complained of the adverse effects of cashless and Naira swap policy on farmers.  Addressing newsmen in Abuja on Saturday, the directorate commended the Friday judgement of the Supreme Court on the policy and called on the Federal Government to put in place palliatives that can help cushion the effects of the poorly implemented monetary policy. A member of the directorate and the National Coordinator Special Projects, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria ( RIFAN), Alhaji Shehu Mu’azu made the call on behalf of the directorate. “It is a known fact that Nigerian farmers were mostly affected by the introduction and the implementation of the cashless policy. We are happy with the Supreme Court judgement and we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to come up with a policy that alleviates the losses suffered by farmers.”
