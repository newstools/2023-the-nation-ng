AFRICAN Democratic Congress (ADC) Govenorship Candidates Forum has  condemned agents of Labour Party (LP), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and others for walking out on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chair, Mahmood Yakubu, during results’ collation. Forum Secretary, Dr. Sani Gumel, in Abuja, condemned the action, saying the victory of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, is proof our democracy is evolving and consolidating. He greeted the president-elect and hailed INEC for conducting a free and fair election. Calling on those who lost to accept the results, the forum urged them, in the spirit of democracy and national interest, to congratulate the winners. “The walk out is condemnable and anti-democracy. If anyone has a grouse, there is a provision that provides for court”. Denouncing the violence, it urged INEC to do more at the governorship/assembly poll. He urged Nigerians to come out and vote without  fear of intimidation.
