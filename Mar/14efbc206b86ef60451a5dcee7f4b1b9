To mark the landslide victory of the president-elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Fuji maestro, Wasiu Ayinde Marshal aka KWAM 1 and Afrobeat sensational Abolore Akande aka 9ice have hit the studio to work on a joint record. The record, according to KWAM 1’s media aide, is entitled: ‘Balablueee to the seat of power.’ The two music stars spent time together in a studio to release the song ahead of the May 29 presidential inauguration ceremony. In the song, K1 described the former Lagos State governor as someone who is embellished with three-power. “Tinubu is powered by the Yoruba people, the late Obafemi Awolowo and M.K.O Abiola,” he enthused in the song. The singer, who recently celebrated his 66th birthday, took to his Instagram page to share a clip of the studio session with 9ice. “Let the message flow, New Era is here,” he captioned. KWAM 1 has continued to show his support and loyalty to Tinubu and other candidates including the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is seeking a second term on March 11.
