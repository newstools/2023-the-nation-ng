AFTER 17 years, Marcelo returned home with a hero’s welcome, as more than 30,000 Fluminense fans attended his unveil at Maracana stadium on Friday night. The former Real Madrid left-back has signed a two-year deal with Brazilian side after terminating his contract with Greece’s Olympiacos. “It’s the best moment of my life, I am coming home. Thank you all!”, Marcelo said to the crowd during his introduction. “I am very, very, very happy! It’s a moment that I have always dreamed of, to  be here with you. I have other dreams as well, which were to wear Fluminense’s jersey again, feel like a warrior again and fight for all trophies. I am sure we will have a wonderful year.” Marcelo signed a contract until December 2024 with an option to extend until the end of 2025, Fluminense said. He left Real Madrid last year as the club’s most decorated player. In 15 years, he won 25 trophies, including five Champions Leagues and six La Ligas. At Fluminense, Marcelo is expected to play as a midfielder and he will wear the No. 12 shirt, the same one he wore in Madrid.
