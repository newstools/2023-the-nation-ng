A Canadian-based singer Dr. Uba Iwunwa-Ndukwe has urged Nigerians to rise above primordial sentiments and financial inducement as they exercise their civic duties in today’s Presidential and National Assembly elections. Iwunwa-Ndukwe, a peace ambassador said it would be tragic for the electorates to sell their votes to the same leaders and commit themselves to another four years of suffering. In a statement following her recent confirmation as ‘Empress of Africa’, the singer urged Nigerians to cast their votes for the most credible, competent and committed candidate as President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor. The statement partly reads, “I feel elated that on February 17, 2023, the Kingdom of David, which has its headquarters in Jerusalem, Israel officially announced me as World Peace and Imperial Royal Diplomat. “But, of course, as a Nigerian, my full attention is on what is happening in Nigeria and the crucial election before us. The citizens have suffered so much through the years and are still suffering with the recent naira redesign policy, fuel scarcity, and insecurity worsening the whole situation. “The critical situation Nigerians have found themselves in ahead of the election has presented them with the golden opportunity to choose the right leader who will lead the country out of its socio-economic and political challenges.”
