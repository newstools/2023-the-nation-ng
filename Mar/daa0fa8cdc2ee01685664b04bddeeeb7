Goods worth millions of naira have been destroyed after fire ravaged the popular Oil Mill Market located along Aba Road in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. The inferno, whose cause could not be determined, was said to have started on Saturday morning. An eyewitness said the fire raged for many hours before fire fighters arrived to put it out. One of the victims said she recently borrowed money to purchase goods, which were all burnt in the fire. She said: “I was still sleeping when I received a call that the market was on fire. When I got there, all my goods and those of others had been destroyed. “A trailer-load of yam, garri and charcoal which we offloaded were all burnt. Women are crying because what they have been using to manage their life has been lost. “Please Governor Wike come and help us. We are dying because of the fire.” The Chairman, Community Development Committee (CDC), Rumuokwurushi, O. C Wosu said the cause of the fire had yet to be determined. He said: “I got distressed calls from so many traders calling me that some sections of the oil mill market were on fire. I quickly called the fire service. As God will have it, the Total E&P fire service, the Shell fire service also came. And they were able to contain the fire.”
