President of St. Finbarr’s College Old Boys Association Patrick Doyle has praised Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for coming to the aid of ailing former Green Eagles captain Henry Nwosu. Doyle, who facilitated the support for Nwosu said the governor displayed the ethos of a passionate leader. Narrating how he facilitated the support, Doyle said: “So you can imagine my consternation when at a moment of despair as president of the St. Finbarr’s College Old Boys Association, I had the onerous responsibility of saving the life of a legendary old boy of Finbarr’s, Henry Nwosu whose health was gravely challenged. I came across the old complimentary card Sanwo-Olu gave me some 20 years previously, and out of a whim I sent an SMS requesting assistance on Henry’s behalf less than five hours later, a positive response came and today Henry is hale and hearty, courtesy of this totally detribalized man. “Neither Henry nor myself are Yoruba; I am Itsekiri, and Henry is Igbo, but the one thing we have in common apart from being Finbarrians is that we were both “Surulere Boys”. The bond of “Surulere Boys” transcends tribe and religion. “We are bound together by the accommodating spirit that pervades every nook and cranny of Lagos. I believe this is what inspired Babajide to rally to the rescue of an “Igbo Lagosian” at the request of a “Waffi Lagosian” with such speed and alacrity. This is the Lagos I know and have come to love, this is the Lagos I urge us to vote for come the 11th of March,” he added. It would be recalled that the Lagos State Government supported Nwosu during his ailment with proper medical support.
