Kelechi Iheanacho may have been vilified for missing a spate of chances as  Leicester City lost to Southampton in the  EPL tie at the weekend,  but Foxes’ coach Brendan Rodgers believed the Nigerian international will soon be back at his scoring best. Iheanacho has been among the goals for  Leicester this season with three goals in 26 Premier League matches and  with another three more goals in as many matches in the traditional FA Cup as he took his total tally to 18 goals from 24 appearances from his days at Manchester City. But his scoring form was amiss on Saturday as he missed glaring opportunities but Rogers has affirmed his confidence in the ‘brilliant’ 27-year-old Super Eagles forward, adding he would still be leading the line at the King Power Stadium.  “He’s been brilliant for us of late,” the manager said as per Leicester Mercury. “He’s been the one who looks like the threat. He kept fighting and kept working. I think it’s a mark of a really good striker to keep going.  “We’ve seen him in recent weeks, where he has taken the opportunities and scored. He had two great opportunities from free headers, and one from the edge of the box, he usually finds the corner with those. It was important for him to hit the target, but it wasn’t to be.  “But he’s still the player that looks like he is going to score for us. I’d rather him miss the opportunities than not have any. On another day, he’ll score those,” he added. Iheanacho has scored six goals in all competitions for City this season, with only James Maddison (nine) and Harvey Barnes (eight) netting more. Four of the Nigerian’s goals have come in his last seven games. Rodgers added: “You lose a game there are always questions, you win a game he’s a fantastic striker. He’s shown up really well in the last number of weeks. It was just unfortunate for him.”
