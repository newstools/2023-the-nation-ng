BANDITS have reportedly attacked Karimbu-Kahugu, a community in Lere Local Government Area, Kaduna State, killing a pastor’s son and kidnapping his wife and three others. The attack, as gathered by The Nation, occurred in the early hours of Friday. The Vice Chairman, Kahugu National Development Association, Mr. Peter Mukaddas, confirmed the incident to journalists, saying that the assailants invaded the village, went straight to the clergy’s residence and took vantage position. It was gathered that the terrorists operated more than one hour unchallenged. In the process, they shot into the ceiling where the pastor’s son was hiding. Mukaddas said they had since reported the matter to the police, but residents in the area are thrown into confusion as contact was yet to be established with the kidnappers. “We are appealing to the government and security agencies to swing into action and ensure our loved ones are rescued,” he said. The spokesman of Kaduna State Police Command, DSP Mohammed Jalige, could not be reached for comments at the time of filing this report.
