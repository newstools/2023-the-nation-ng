The Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited has assured that it is committed to actualising its plan of supplying its product, the LNG, to the domestic market as part of its contribution to the growth of domestic gas utilisation. The Manager, Common Facilities Assets, NLNG, Mr. Lateef Biobaku, gave the hint at a panel session in Lagos. To actualise this target, the firm said its offtakers of the product -Asiko Power Limited, Bridport Energy Limited and Gas-Plus Synergy Limited – were constructing their receiving infrastructure in Apapa and Lekki Free Zone in readiness for the commencement of supply. Recall that in June 2021, the NLNG had assured it would begin domestic LNG supply a year later, adding that it had signed Sales and Purchase Agreements (SPAs) with three power firms as offtakers. Biobaku reassured that the firm remained committed to delivering LNG to the market as its partners were constructing their receiving facilities which has had some delays due to some constraints in the industry. “But nevertheless, we are working with them to make sure that they deliver to their promises. Coincidentally, a team of NLNG officials are in Lagos going to visit those facilities to make sure that everything is on track. They have been to Apapa and would also be going to the Lekki Free Trade Zone, just to make sure that those companies fulfil their promises,” Biobaku said. The company has a six-train LNG processing plant in Bonny Island, Rivers State, with total 22 million tones per annum (22mtpa) and 5mtpa of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) capacity. It is also building the seventh train capable of raising its LNG production capacity to 30mtpa. NLNG has dedicated 100 per cent of its Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) production to the market to  encourage local utilisation of the cleaner energy source, reduce importation of the product and save foreign exchange.
