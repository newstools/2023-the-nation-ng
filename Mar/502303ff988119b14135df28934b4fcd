He added that the new outlet will be one of the best so far. Oluchi believes that the greater the risk an investor is willing to take, the greater the potential return. This core belief has defined the paths he has taken in life, and such that has brought great wealth to him in the long run. The young entrepreneur ventured into the computer retail business when many saw no business in it. But with determination, he is a success story today.
