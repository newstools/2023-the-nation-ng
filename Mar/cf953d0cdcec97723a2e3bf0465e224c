Ayodeji ‘Wizkid’ Balogun has dashed the hopes of millions of fans looking forward to his highly anticipated tour, ‘More Love, Less Ego.’ The singer dashed the hopes when he announced the postponement of the scheduled music tour on Thursday, March 2. Wizkid, through his official Twitter account, announced that he was postponing his upcoming ‘More Love, Less Ego’ tour due to unforeseen logistical circumstances. While Wizkid’s ‘More Love, Less Ego Tour’ tour was initially scheduled to kick off today, March 3, with a show at the Houston Toyota Centre, the announcement of the postponement came as a surprise to fans who were gearing up to see him perform across 18 cities in the U.S. and Canada. Wizkid gave a terse announcement noting that the tour has since been moved to fall. However, the statement didn’t specifically indicate which month in fall, since the season  falls in September, October, and November. However, Wizkid is set to make history with a performance at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium on July 29.
