Being a fit, smart and fun mother has earned Mrs. Joy Obieze, Mrs. Ivbade Odigie and Mrs. Oluchukwu Rose Igwe an all-expenses-paid trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and one year’s supply of peak milk. The women emerged winners recently in a keen contest that attracted over 300,000 entries, which were screened and narrowed down to the top six contestants, to select the Mum of the Year 2022. The campaign, which started with a call for members of the public to nominate any mother or mother figure deserving of a much-needed vacation, an all-expenses-paid trip to Dubai, an amazing travel destination, has been on since 2016 with just one mum as the winner enjoying the trip. However, as the milk brand clocked 30 years in 2018, more winners were recognized for the star prize, taking the number to three mothers, who were eligible to travel to Dubai with two family members. At a colourful grand finale in Lagos anchored by Bukunmi Adeaga-Ilori, aka Kiekie, Chris Wulff-Caesar, marketing director, FrieslandCampina, sub-Saharan Africa cluster, said: “Motherhood can be a thankless job and even when mothers are appreciated, one can never repay them for all they do. This is the reason we created the Mum of the Year campaign, to show appreciation for mothers or mother figures and give them their well-deserved rest and pampering.”
