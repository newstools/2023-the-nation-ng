The leadership of the Eko Foundation has urged voters in Lagos not to pander to sentiments by voting for persons with unknown leadership records in Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly election. It said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu deserved a second term because he has delivered on his campaign promises of developing the state. The foundation stated this in a statement by its President Prof Wole Smith (SAN), Secretary Dr. Mobolaji Akerele and Legal Adviser Lawal Pedro (SAN). “We urge the good people of Lagos State to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC). “His Excellency Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu deserves a second term as governor for his striking and enviable achievements in the administration and development of the state. “Sanwo-Olu’s administration is an inclusive one and over the years, APC has been magnanimous towards all tribes within the state. “It is safer to go with the benevolent APC with a convincing pedigree rather than risk the unknown. “We urge the good people of Lagos State to vote for progress, continuity, consolidation and sustainability,” the foundation said. It urged every tribe in the state to avoid comments capable of creating disunity in the state and to reciprocate the accommodative disposition of Lagos. The foundation also congratulated the president-elect Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on his victory in the February 25 election. “We congratulate His Excellency, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu on his election as the next President of Nigeria,” it added.
