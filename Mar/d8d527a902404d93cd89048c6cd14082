The Aneke film star twin Chidiebere has offered counsel to actresses who claim to be victims of alleged s3x-for-roles among movie producers. A handful of actresses in the past have alleged to have been experienced producers and even directors demanding s3x from them in exchange for movie roles. The twin actress, speaking in a recent interview with the PUNCH, commented on her experiences.  Aneke suggested producers are freely handed such opportunity by actresses who visit their rooms unsolicitedly and those who decided to attain success through the back door. Revealing, she had never been a victim of the supposed trend, the 36-year-old role interpreter advised her female colleagues against going to producers’ rooms and using the back door during auditioning for roles. She said: “My experience over the years has been great and wonderful. It has not been easy and I am still learning. But, I thank God for everything. “There are some people that come online to say that producers asked them for sex before they could be given roles in their movies. However, no one has personally come to report such an incident to me. “What I will advise as the way forward is that people who say producers ask them for sex should stop going to the producers’ rooms, when they don’t have anything to do there. Whenever there are calls for auditions, these actresses should not go in through the back door.”
