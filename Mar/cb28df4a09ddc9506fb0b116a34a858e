Arafa, one of the cast of Real Housewives of Abuja, initiated a drama that can be likened to a Chioma and Laura’s fight in the season one of Real Housewives of Lagos. In the first episode, all the girls met at Samantha’s party and in keeping with the Real Housewives tradition. In the second episode of the Showmax Original reality series, it was Arafa’s turn to have the girls over for a “drag-themed party.” The drama began with who got an invite or not, but that’s not our focus here. The ladies pulled off the theme look and they gave good surprises, especially Princess Jecoco. The Princess, through her chatter, claimed that she and Arafa supposedly knew each other before the show. Princess said she and Arafa were “acquaintances” from the multiple parties they had attended or met, but Arafa was having none of that. Like deja vu, Arafa denied knowing Princess. As if that wasn’t enough, the Princess insisted on being an acquaintance of Arafa at her party when she spoke with the other ladies, but Arafa still maintained her stance. If looks could choke, Princess Jecoco would have spluttered and coughed from the look the party girl was giving her.
