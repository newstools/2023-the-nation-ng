Tottenham are facing a battle to persuade Thomas Tuchel to be their new manager. Ex-Chelsea boss Tuchel and former Spurs chief Mauricio Pochettino are the top candidates to succeed Antonio Conte. It is now a matter of when, not if, Conte departs after a week from hell in which  the club crashed out of both the FA Cup and Champions League. His deal expires in the summer and Spurs will not  extend it even as Chairman Daniel Levy is understood to have reservations about bringing back fans’ favourite Pochettino. But if he plumps for Tuchel, he needs to convince the German coach he can give him the tools to make Tottenham serious trophy challengers. Spurs have no immediate plans to get rid of the Italian, who has just recovered from emergency gallbladder surgery. But the board could change tack if they feel Tottenham’s chances of finishing in the top four are under threat. Tuchel, 49, has been a free agent since his shock Stamford Bridge axing by Chelsea’s billionaire owner Todd Boehly in September. The ex-Borussia Dortmund boss insists he was a Spurs fan growing up and was fascinated by their “adventurous” Tottenham Hotspur name.
