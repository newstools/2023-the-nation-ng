A federal judge in Chicago, the United States of America has sentenced American singer, R. Kelly, to 20 years in prison for child s3x crimes. The latest judgment was handed to him after a jury found that he had produced three videos of himself s3xually molesting his 14-year-old goddaughter. The judge ruled that all but one year of the prison sentence would be served at the same time alongside a previous 30-year sentence that the embattled received after a jury in Brooklyn convicted him of racketeering and s3x trafficking charges in 2022.

However, R. Kelly was acquitted of a charge that he had attempted to impede an earlier investigation into his abuse of the goddaughter, and two other counts of enticing minors to have sex. Federal prosecutors had argued that the 56-year-old ‘Ignition’ singer deserved 25 years imprisonment in addition to his earlier sentence, citing the singer’s “lack of remorse” as a reason he would pose a danger to society if released.
