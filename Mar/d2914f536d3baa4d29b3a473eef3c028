Two women have called on the Chairman of Lagos Parks and Garages Community MC Oluomo to help them their colleagues and the masses instead of popular actress, Iyabo Ojo. The woman who was with a friend argued based on their loyalty to MC and his principal, the president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, they deserve to enjoy his largess than the actress who doesn’t support Tinubu but Peter Obi. In a viral video, the women who expressed themselves in Yoruba, chided Ojo for being an ingrate. Fuming, the women said: “Hello, you see us; we are Tinubu’s supporters. Helps us, it’s the same principal we support. “MC, helps us the theatre practitioners; the masses. Iyabo Ojo is an unfortunate person, she’s just collecting money from you. Help us instead of her. “Help us the masses. We don’t have money, but we always do your bidding. Anywhere we go, we go pray for you. We are Tinubu’s core loyalists. “We always pray for you. We voted for APC because we love him. Tinubu is the one we carry in our hearts. We have never collected money from you.” Read Also : Iyabo Ojo implicates colleague over alleged threat to life Recently, actress Dayo Amusa threw shades at her colleague, Iyabo Ojo over her support for Peter Obi which allegedly caused a rift between her and MC Oluomo, who is a staunch supporter and godson of Tinubu.
