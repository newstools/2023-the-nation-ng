After securing first place in Group B of the TotalEnergies U-20 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, Uganda are already looking forward to their quarter-final clash against Nigeria. The Hippos who finished level on five points with Congo before the drawing of lots in Cairo confirmed their place at the summit, will face the Flying Eagles on Thursday. Jackson Mayanja’s team played South Sudan who qualified in third at the Suez Canal Stadium in Ismailia on Sunday night but the CECAFA representatives cancelled each other with South Sudan having the better of the chances. “This tournament is a bit tricky but this is the game but we had to get a result because I also rested my key players because I trust every player,” Mayanja said.”Since that we have qualified, now we’re planning for the next one so that we can qualify to the next stage.” While Jackson Mayanja was fulfilling his post-match media duties the drawing of lots was taking place in Cairo but the former El Masry man wasn’t too concerned about the draw. “There’s nothing much I can say about the drawing of lots. I’m not a coach who has pressure,” he said.”This is what I was looking at whether I am first or second but I have qualified that is the most important. “My goal here in this tournament is to take this team to the World Cup. “That’s why I give a chance to every player of mine to express himself, to express talent.”
