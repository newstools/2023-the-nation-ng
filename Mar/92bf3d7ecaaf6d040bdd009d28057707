Antonio Conte’s reign as Tottenham manager appears to be rapidly drawing to a close after the club’s limp Champions League exit at the hands of AC Milan. The Italian was back on the touchline on Wednesday after recovering from gallbladder surgery but upbeat pre-game talk about infusing his players with energy came to nothing. The club’s long-suffering fans are now coming to terms with a 15th straight season without a trophy following the 0-0 draw in the last 16 of the Champions League, which meant Milan progressed 1-0 on aggregate. The atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium turned toxic, with the home fans angrily voicing their disapproval at full-time. The result capped a disastrous seven days for Spurs, who exited the FA Cup last week away to second-tier Sheffield United and lost at Wolves on Saturday. Those results, along with Conte’s health problems, have led to mounting speculation that the Italian’s tenure is coming to an end. The 53-year-old, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, was cagey over his immediate future after the Milan defeat but admitted the club could sack him. “This is not the right day to speak about the future but I have a contract with Tottenham and Tottenham know very well my thoughts and at the end of the season we will meet and make a decision,” Conte said. “I have a great relationship with my chairman (Daniel Levy), with Fabio Paratici (director of football), but it doesn’t mean I don’t tell them which is my vision, you understand? Then we will see. “Now we have to finish the season. I have a contract until June. I am happy to work in Tottenham but at the end will make a decision.” Conte walked through the door at Spurs in November 2021 as a serial winner at Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Milan. But his pragmatic approach has been criticised by fans who are not prepared to compromise on the club’s attacking traditions.
