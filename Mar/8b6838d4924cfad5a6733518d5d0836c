Delta All Progressives Congress(APC) Founding Leader and South-South Director of the Directorate of Contacts and Mobilization of the APC-Tinubu Presidential Campaign Council, Olorogun O’tega Emerhor OON, has applauded the APC chapter for its doggedness in raking out three NASS wins in the last Saturday’s elections despite the huge hurdles.  In a statement he signed,  Emerhor applauded the governorship candidate Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, the Chairman of the party, Elder Omeni Sobotie and all leaders and members of the party for a job well done.  Emerhor noted that despite the shenanigans and wicked electoral manipulations of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) and the strong than expected performance by the Labour Party in Delta State, the APC stood its ground as a well rooted party.  He said it was.commendable the party delivered two Senators and a House of Representatives member, which he said is a clear indication that the APC is the most grounded grassroot party in Delta State.  Emerhor also congratulated Chief Ede Dafinone, Senator-Elect for Delta Central, Chief Joel Onowakpo Thomas, Senator-Elect for Delta South and Rev Francis Waive, House of Representatives Member-Elect for Ughelli North, Ughelli South and Udu constituency for their well deserved victories at the polls. He challenged all APC members in Delta State to up the game and ramp up voter mobilisation in readiness for March 11 to deliver Senator Ovie Omo-Agege as Governor and APC Assembly candidates.  “The indications cannot be better. The whole nation has just entrusted the APC with the Presidency by delivering our candidate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as President-Elect. PDP is currently bemused, this is the time to finally bury PDP rescue Delta State from its maladministration, ” he stressed.
