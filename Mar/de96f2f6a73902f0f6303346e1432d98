Despite scoring in Leicester City’s fifth-round exit in the FA Cup to Blackburn Rovers, Kelechi Iheanacho did not hide his disappointment over their ouster from the tournament, while promising to net more goals in the Premiership. Iheanacho came from the bench to score at King Power Stadium, after earlier goals from Tyrhys Dolan and Sammie Szmodics for Rovers, but his Leicester teammates could not save the team’s exit. “It’s so disappointing, especially at home. It wasn’t good enough. If you don’t do what you need to do, you get punished. Obviously, that’s gone now, we need to look forward to the Premier League, but we need to do more,” the Nigerian ace told LCFC TV. Iheanacho now has six goals this season, five of which have come since the New Year, including three in the FA Cup and he is excited to be back among the goals, but he showed his frustration with the result. “It was a good ball from Barnsey (Harvey Barnes), on the flank, taking it well and working the man, cutting it back,” he explained. “It was the right cross at the right time. Hopefully, there’s more to come, but we’re out of the competition now. “It’s a tough one to take. As I said, we need to do more, to stay in the league and get up there.” For Iheanacho, scoring goals remain his priority this season. “I am happy that I am scoring; I just need to be composed in front of the goal and hopefully more to come,” he added.
