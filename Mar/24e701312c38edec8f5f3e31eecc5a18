Thirty two of the 102 victims of Thursday’s Lagos train collision have been discharged, Commissioner for Health Prof Akin Abayomi has stated. Abayomi told reporters at a briefing at Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) on Friday that the number of deceased from the collision remains six.  He said 19 survivors have been discharged from LASUTH, five from the State Accident and Emergency Centre at Old Toll Gate and eight from Orile-Agege General Hospital. He added 256 units of voluntary blood was received on Thursday from Lagos State residents, while 40 units of blood had been transferred for the victims on Friday.  According to him: “It is important to note that from about 12 noon yesterday till now, we have not lost any other passengers from this accident. So, the act of triage was very important in saving lives and reducing the casualty of this ghastly accident. “At the same time, there are very few hospitals in the world that can cope with a sudden surge of very critically injured patients, so the triage process also identifies some of the injured passengers that can be transferred to other established general hospitals in Lagos. ” 25 of the less severely injured to four of our general hospitals were transferred to Gbagada General Hospital, Lagos Island General Hospital, the Toll Gate Accident and Emergency Centre, and the Orile Agege General Hospital. “I went to visit them after I left LASUTH, and all of them are stable and doing fine. Some of them will indeed be discharged later on today.”
