The Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Oyo stste has distanced itself from what it described as purported endorsement of Governor Seyi Makinde for a second term in office by a group of people who claimed to be elders’ forum of the council. Oyo IPAC Chairman, Apostle Dare Ojo, gave the clarification in a statement issued on Friday in Ibadan. He said the Elders forum exist only as a peace mediating group within the Council and not a group to either make public pronouncement or speak publicly on political issues. He said those who made the pronouncement in support of a particular political party against others who are also fielding candidates in the same election did not mean well for the peace of the state. He said those who were behind the act belonged to different political parties before they were deregistered by the electoral umpire. He said the elders’ forum is not expected to use the name of the Council for any political transactions.  He warned those behind the public declaration to desist from dragging the name and integrity of the Council in the mud, stating that such an unethical behavior will attract drastic action if not stopped forthwith. The statement reads, “This is to notify the public that Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Oyo state chapter has no part in a press release by the Conference of deregistered political parties.  They all belong to one or other political parties before they were deregistered. Our elders in IPAC are to settle crisis within us and not to use the name IPAC Elders Forum for political transaction. IPAC is for everybody and for no body. Nobody has the right to drag the integrity of IPAC to mud. “I, Apostle Dare Ojo the Chairman of IPAC on behalf of my Exco and all other registered political parties in Oyo state categorically dissociate our self from such press release. We strongly warn those that are using IPAC name to stop such unethical behavior henceforth or else drastic action will be taken against them.”
