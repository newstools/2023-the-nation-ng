THE President of the Chartered Institute of Transport Administration (CIOTA), Prince Segun Ochuko Obayendo, has expressed heartfelt condolences to families and friends of those who lost their lives and those injured in the tragic incident involving a train and a BRT bus at Ikeja Lagos. “I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Lagos State Government, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and all residents of the state. “Anytime we lose souls to incidents such as this, at CIOTA, it is like a stab to our hearts, and a rude awakening to how to further build on our advocacy to sensitize Nigerians on how to effectively use every means of transportation: land, rail, air, pipeline, etc without endangering their lives and that of other citizens and putting safety measures in place. “In light of today’s incident, we will work with states in the federation and ensure there are barricades on all roads linked with or around our rail tracks. Once the train is a few kilometers ahead, the barricades will block the roads, preventing the movement of vehicles and other road users and  this will forestall avoidable deaths on our railways as it obtains in developed nations.” CIOTA expressed gratitude to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), who sprang into action.
