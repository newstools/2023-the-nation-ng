The Chief Imam of Lagos State, Sheikh Sulaimon Oluwatoyin Abou-Nolla has congratulated the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Abou-Nolla said Tinubu’s victory was a reward for long years of hard work and consistency in pursuing a worthy goal. According to him, Tinubu’s emergence should excite Nigerians because his presidency would impact positively the socio-economic development of the country. Tinubu, he said, has good exposure to how to improve the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) without inconveniencing the downtrodden. The revered cleric said: “Let me first congratulate Asiwaju Tinubu on his victory. He deserves to be elected because of his long preparation and the assiduous efforts he has invested in leading the country. He knew the challenges of Nigeria having been in the system for a long time and has the ability to turn things round. Nigerians can count on his capacity to assemble a good team that will formulate and implement masses-oriented policies. Such policies are critical for the development of human and material resources.” He urged Nigerians especially the political class to join hands with him to move the country forward. Sheikh Sulaimon beseeched Allah to grant Tinubu the wisdom, guidance, strength and courage to deliver on his promises. The Lagos Chief Imam, however, enjoined the president-elect to carefully select those that would work with him, adding that his appointees could make or mar his administration. He prayed to Allah to guide Tinubu in choosing good, competent, and compassionate people to drive his vision.
