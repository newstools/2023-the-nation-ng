Fast rising music producer, David Dante Okiti aka Don Dante has explained that passion drives his quota contribution to placing the Afrobeats genre on the world map. Dante noted that he has always been involved in creating sounds as the complexity of sounds excites him. “I have always been involved in creating sounds from a very young age. As one who plays live instruments, I enjoy the complexity of sounds. I found myself playing the drum in church at age six, later went on playing the keys and started mixing sounds together,” he said. “All of these experiences have come together to give me an edge. As a music producer, I try to stay ahead of the game by upping my skills and constantly refreshing my knowledge. The world is in need of new sounds and the Afrobeats genre is here to fill up that void. That is where I come in.” Some of the notable jams that have Dante’s imprint include Peruzzi’s ‘Hypertension,’ Davido’s ‘Very Special’, ‘Things I Need’, May D’s ‘Lowo Lowo’ featuring Davido and many more.
