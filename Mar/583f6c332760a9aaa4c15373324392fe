Nigerian defender Rasheed Sodiq has become the rave of the moment in the Macedonian top league following the superlative display that saw him nominated for the North Macedonian 1. MFL Team of the week for weeks 17, 18, and 20. Sodiq joined Macedonian club FK Skopje in January on a free transfer and has gone to be the rock of FK Skopje’s defense. The electrifying defender wastes no time getting applause from the Macedonian media as the new rock in the league. The 22-year-old defender has started all four of FK Skopje’s games since he arrived. With him in defense, the club has lost just one game and kept two clean sheets. Sodiq was at the heart of the defense when FK Skopje drew 1-1 against Makedonija GP recently. In a chat with his US-base uncle Anthony Ushurhe, who disclosed that his recent form has shifted focus on him, scouts across major European leagues are watchful and in contact with his agent. The former Messiah FC and Remo Stars man played all 90 minutes for his club, helping them seal the result. However, despite his impact, Skopje still sits deep in relegation waters. They sit tenth in the league, five points away from safety. But obviously, a bigger move is on the cards for the talented Nigerian defender who had a dream of playing for the Super Eagles of Nigeria. All eyes will be on Sodiq as FK Skope visits fourth-placed Sileks on Sunday afternoon. The game is expected to entertain scouts from France, Belgium, and Germany to watch the Nigerian player.
