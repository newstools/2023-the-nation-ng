Steve Cooper has delivered an injury update on Taiwo Awoniyi and two Nottingham Forest players following Sunday’s 2-2 draw with Everton. Awoniyi, Cheikhou Kouyate, and Moussa Niakhate are the trio of starts that the head coach has provided reports on. Chris Wood and Emmanuel Dennis are the only fit centre-forwards, whilst Joe Worrall and Felipe are the only central defensive options. Awoniyi has also been a huge miss. He had just started to accustom to life in the Premier League and he was playing really well in the left-sided forward role that Cooper looks to utilise. Now, Cooper has delivered an update on the trio of Forest stars. The head coach told the media: “Cheikhou (Kouyate) is not far away. Taiwo (Awoniyi) is not far away. Moussa is not far away. They are three really big players for us. We’ll just focus on the next game, see who’s available and commit to the plan.” It will be such a huge boost to have the three injured players back in contention. The Reds are facing a really crucial period and perhaps those three could be the difference. Awoniyi has scored a number of goals this season. His return would ease the burden on the likes of Brennan Johnson and Morgan Gibbs-White as the Reds aim to stay up.
