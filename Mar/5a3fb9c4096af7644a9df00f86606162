The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Enugu State, Rev Amb Emmanuel Ositadinma Edeh, has advised politicians in the state to appreciate the enduring peace that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has labored to entrench by desisting from hate speech, a campaign of calumny, character assassination and all acts of violence ahead of the March 11 Governorship and State Assembly elections. Rev Edeh, in a statement, said that Christians in the State are worried over the rate some politicians and their agents are going about overheating the polity, and maligning the integrity of their opponents as well as the sacredness of leaders of religious institutions in their desperate attempt to achieve cheap political goals. The Enugu State CAN Chairman condemned the negative acts, adding that they are “strange and inimical to the enduring and cherished peace and good governance initiatives of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration since its inception in 2015” Rev Edeh described Governor Ugwuanyi as “a peacemaker and wonderful being whom God has used in uniting and promoting peace in Enugu State, and in advancing good governance in the State, especially in the rural areas in the overall interest of the long-neglected rural dwellers for them to feel the direct impact of democracy dividends” wondering why some people who are too desperate for power, would resort to acts capable of undermining the governor’s good legacy at all costs. The cleric recalled that he had in one of the State functions of CAN in Enugu described Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi “as a bulwark, strong pillar of faith and highly cherished partner of the Christian community, who will be greatly remembered for his peaceful disposition, rural development initiative, inclusive governance, humility, compassion for the downtrodden, deep commitment to God, great respect for the leaders of religious institutions and his invaluable support to the Christian community in the State.” Edeh expressed deep concern over the recent political killings in the State and prayed for the repose of the faithful departed. He pleaded with those who might still be planning to unleash mayhem in Enugu State to desist from such untoward acts which the State is not known for. The cleric further advised those beating the drum of war over the coming elections to change their orientation, and called on all politicians in Enugu State to see politics as a game and not a battle field which must be approached as a do-or-die affair.  My appreciation to our God-fearing, peace-loving and indefatigable Governor of Enugu State, His Excellency, Rt Hon Dr Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi CON, a man with a heart of gold, a listening and action Governor whom God is using mightily to maintain unparalleled peace and security in our dear Enugu State. A GOOD MAN INDEED, THOUGH NOT PERFECT AS NO ONE IS PERFECT! The CAN Chairman, therefore, called on “all Christians in our dear Enugu State and beyond to harken unto the admonitions of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to Watch and Pray that the Will of God be done in Enugu State, so that we can sustain peace and good governance in our State, Amen”
