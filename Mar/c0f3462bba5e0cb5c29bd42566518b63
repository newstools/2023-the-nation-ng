Nollywood actress Adunni Ade has called out some of her colleagues over their choice of presidential candidate saying they were induced by pecuniary gains. In a rant on her official Instagram handle, the ‘Soole’ actress chided her colleagues for allegedly collecting a paltry sum of N90,000 to campaign for a candidate. Not to let the accusation slide, one of her colleagues, Bukky Adekogbe responded to Adunni Ade stating that the said sum received by some actors was not the aim of campaigning for their preferred candidate. She noted that the facilitator of the campaign is a friend of the film industry and can call upon the thespians for support anytime. Adunni Ade, in her rant, also expressed displeasure about the outcome at her polling unit’s result, claiming that the voting process was allegedly disrupted the following morning by some thugs. She also alleged that a certain official of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, refused to input the results of her polling units after counting the votes.
