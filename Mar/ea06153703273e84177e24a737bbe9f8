Self-styled ‘wahala’ musician Portable has released a new single titled: ‘Obi is a boy’. The lyric of the double-edged track praises the president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu while shading the opposition candidate, Peter Obi who came distant third at the poll. The song, a tribute to Tinubu, also mocks the aggrieved LP opposition candidate. Dr Zeh, as he also refers to himself, tagged Obi as a boy while he hailed Tinubu, calling out his nickname, Jagaban, describing him as a father. Portable shared a video of himself as he hit the studio to record the song.  He captioned the post: “Obi is a boy.  Jagaban na person father Asiwaju Na Boss.  Eyin Omo YORUBA it’s another 30 years again that we always denied our own Father brother and son I hope we break the curse this year. Nibo Wontobe Ashiwaju leader of the leaders. Wahala Wahala Wahala. Dr ZEH Cooking NewHit @it_omega.” (sic) Sharing the completed track which has a visual of his cartooned self, doing his signature dance step, Portable wrote: “Obi Is A Boy. Wahala Wahala Wahala. Beat by @it_omega. ZEH Nation Many many inspiration.”
