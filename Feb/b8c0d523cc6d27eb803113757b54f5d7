An evangelist, Gospel Agochukwu, has claimed ‘heavenly bank’ supplied him new naira notes. Agochukwu, who said he was in the dire need of cash but couldn’t access any, claimed to have found new naira notes in the pages of his Bible. He shared photos of the money he allegedly found in his Bible via his Facebook page on Friday. “Needed Cash to get something urgent and help a family without bank account but couldn’t find; I opened one of my bible and found some new Naira notes. “Bank of Heaven has supplied me already. Miracle no de tire Jesus,” he posted.
