Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw has expressed her disappointment at the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), over the inability to vote at her polling unit. The actress and TV show compere complained that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation (BVAS) could not recognize her even though her name is on the list and also in the INEC official website. “INEC, I registered, I transferred my card. I picked up my pvc now your BVAS is saying I’m not registered but I have seen my name on the register on the wall and on your website,” said Henshaw in  a video shared on social media. “What are you guys doing? It’s like you people want problems with me. CNN, BBC, anybody watching this video from outside the country, INEC is playing games, it’s not just me but there are so many people here who have not been found on the BVAS, please whoever is in charge of INEC Lagos needs to come and sort it out in the polling unit here, I beg you.”
