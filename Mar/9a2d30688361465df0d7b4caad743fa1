A former presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Stanley Osifo has appealed to Nigerians, especially the candidates in the postponed governorship and state houses of assembly elections as well as members of political parties to remain calm and allow INEC to do what will enable a successful election. Osifo who made the appeal in Lagos on Friday described the Court judgement given to INEC to reconfigure BVAS for the second phase of the general elections as a round peg in a round hole. The APC chieftain blamed disruption of INECâ€™s arrangement for the March 11th governorship and state houses of assembly poll on the recent Court applications by the aggrieved parties at the outcome of. February 25th Presidential election. He noted that the postponement of the gubernatorial and state houses of assembly including some senatorial and Federal House of Representatives elections earlier scheduled for 11th March 2023 to 18th March 2023 is seen by many as a development that was never expected.
