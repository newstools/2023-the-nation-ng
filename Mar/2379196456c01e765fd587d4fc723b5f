Lagos State Chairman of the South-West Agenda,(SWAGA), a campaign organization for the actualisation of Tinubu’s presidency, Alhaji Monsuru Owolabi Alao,has described the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the president-elect as a good omen. He said his election which will lead APC to a spectacular landslide victory across the nation and Lagos State, in particular, the governorship and House of Assembly polls on Saturday. Referring to the recent presidential election, Alao said that the generality of  Lagosians were in solid support of Tinubu and the APC but unfortunately fears of possible violent eruption,and the excruciating hardship occasioned by the dramatic change of currency kept a good number of them indoors,while on the contrary, the largely Igbo supporters of the Labour party,who regarded it purely as a do-or-die battle to oust the Yorubas and take-over their inheritance from them,turned out enmasse to vote for the Labour Party. The SWAGA chief who dismissed the high electoral figure of the Labour Party as highly exaggerated said that over-confidence on the part of Lagosians and massive malpractices  like over-voting as validly documented in some parts of the state,also contributed largely to the outcome of the election. “Following the unexpected development, party stakeholders  embarked on  an intense re-awakening of Lagosians,and I can confidently tell you that Lagosians are extremely shocked and have therefore vowed to turn out in their large numbers at the polls on Saturday because of their deep love for Asiwaju and the marvellous performances of Governor Sanwo-Olu,which are all visible for all to see.They have sworn that Sanwo-Olu will surely serve a second tenure,as they will all troop out to support him enmasse this time around and all the APC members for the Lagos House of Assembly”,said the ex legislator and Four-term member of the Federal House of Representatives. He remarked that right from the colonial era, beginning from Herbert Macaulay,to the Awolowo-led UPN and the Tinubu era as governor, Lagosians have always aligned with the progressive tendency adding that it will be suicidal if  by any stroke of misfortune,they will relinquish their birthright to an alien clothed in the fake garb of a yoruba man and Lagosian, and noted for his subdued anti-yoruba passion,to rubbish and desecrate their illustrious heritage and turn them to slaves and paupers in the land of their ancestors. He urged the Igbos to be reasonable enough as to read the handwriting on the wall and therefore turn a new leaf by voting enmasse for Sanwo-Olu and all the APC Candidates since it is apparent that the Labour Party and PDP have already lost out even before the election “Over the years, we Lagosians have been extremely kind and accommodating to you people.It is therefore morally right and proper to reciprocate by joining force with the people and  government which has given you a sense of belonging as brothers and even co-opted some of you into the mainstream of governance.It makes no sense to fight a loosing battle since all the indications are there that Labour Party can never ever win since time and tide has already turned against them”,Owolabi Alao said. The APC  chieftain, urged the Mainland electorates to troop out enmasse on Saturday and vote massively for Hon Ajani Owolabi-Alao and Rasheed Shabi, representing Mainland constituency 1 and Mainland constituency 11 respectively He seized the opportunity to express thanks for their immense support which contributed largely to the victory of APC Candidate for the House of Reps Hon Moshood Olanrewaju Oshun at the polls last Saturday and also for the success of Hon Wasiu Sanni Eshinlokun as the elected candidate for the Lagos Central Senatorial District.
