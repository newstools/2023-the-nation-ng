FOLARIN Balogun probably didn’t envisage him to be the subject of intensifying interest from a host of top European clubs a year ago, but that’s the exact scenario he finds himself in today. Following a number of impressive displays on loan at Stade de Reims where he has become the joint Ligue 1 top scorer alongside Kylian Mbappe and Jonathan David with 15 goals, Balogun is now a wanted man ahead of the summer transfer window, casting some doubt over his Arsenal future. Prior to his switch to France, Balogun struggled to stamp down a place in the Arsenal first-team and endured a tough loan spell at Middlesbrough last season, scoring just three goals in 21 appearances. Ready for a new challenge, Balogun previously spoke about the advice he had received from Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka before emphasising his desire to improve. “I speak to Emile and Bukayo a lot,” he said. “They tell me to be patient. They tell me it is not an overnight thing, which it hasn’t been for them. It would be naive for me to think that. You just have to keep practicing, then you see the rewards and when you are ready you will take the opportunity. I know I am not at the level I want to be, but I know the performances I am putting in. I know I am going in the right direction.” Speaking to the press a couple of weeks ago, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta expressed his delight over Balogun’s progress and confirmed that a decision over his future would be made at the end of the season. “So happy for him,” Arteta began. “He’s a boy with a really clear idea of what he wants to do in his career. Really ambitious, really committed and he’s really brave. We discussed before whether it was the right place to go and other choices that he had. He was so convinced and I’m really happy for him because he deserves what he’s getting.
