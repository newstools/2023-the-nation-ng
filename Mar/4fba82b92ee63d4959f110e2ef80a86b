Welsey Fofana scored his first Premier League goal for Chelsea as the Blues beat Leeds to ease the pressure on manager Graham Potter. After a run of just two wins in their past 15 games, there was a sense that three points were a must for Potter, despite insisting he retained the support of the club’s owners before the game. The Blues made a blistering start and could have been 3-0 up inside 30 minutes. Kai Havertz was one-on-one with Leeds keeper Illan Meslier, while Joao Felix smashed a shot from distance against the crossbar before Ben Chilwell prodded wide from an excellent position.

But Fofana ended Chelsea’s run of 396 minutes without a goal when he rose to head home from a corner early in the second half. Leeds upped the pressure in the closing stages as the hosts dropped deep to try and hold on for a precious win, making for a nervous finale to the game for the home fans, but they held on to secure their second win this year. Chelsea remain 10th despite the win while Leeds are 17th and one point above the relegation zone.
