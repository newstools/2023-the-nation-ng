Lagos Boxing Hall of Fame (LBHF), the organisers of the Lagos Monthly Saturday Boxing Show yesterday announced its decision to not to host this month’s edition of the event. The show, which brings together the best amateur pugilists in Lagos state, was scheduled to hold on the last Saturday of the month at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Sports Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos will now hold at a date later to be announced. In a statement sent to NationSports, the secretary of LABA, Lawal Yussuf, said that the decision to not hold the premier amateur boxing event in Nigeria was to respect Muslim faithful as they undergo the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which will start on the 23rd while the boxing show was slated to hold two days later. He said: “The Saturday Boxing Show which was scheduled to be held on the last Saturday of the month will not be held because of the holy month of Ramadan. The above stated reason has been the tradition since inception to observe a break during the holy month of Ramadan. “This is an act of respect for our Muslim brothers and sisters as they undergo their yearly fasting. “Moving the event to a later date will also ensure that our athletes are in top shape for the next competition in April,” he added. As one of Nigeria’s longest running sporting events, the Boxing Show pulls hundreds of boxing fans from the nooks and crannies of Lagos State every last Saturday of the month as well as amateur boxers who are only too happy to showcase their skills in the ring. It has been on-going since July 2009 and hosted its last edition, the 124th edition, in January. However, the 125th edition which was to be held on 25 February was also postponed because of the Nigerian general elections held on the same day.
