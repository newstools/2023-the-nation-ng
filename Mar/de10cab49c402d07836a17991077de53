Popular media personality, Daddy Freeze has argued most Nigerian pastors do not hear from any god much more from the true God. Seeing there were a number of prophecies from different cleric about the elections, particularly the presidential polls, he insisted the outcomes validate his point. While citing Bible verses on consequences of prophecies without the unction of the Almighty, Daddy Freeze said the contemporary prophets that fell in the aforementioned category should be thankful. He noted they would have been severely dealt with had it been this time was like when the scriptures were being written. He wrote: “Dear Nigerian pastors, can we now agree that a majority of you do not hear shi shi from any god; let alone the true God? This election is living proof.  “Thank your village stars that we do not live in the era that these scriptures were written, una for hear weeen. “- Deuteronomy 18 New International Version [20] But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to de@th.” “[21] You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?”  “[22] If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed.”
