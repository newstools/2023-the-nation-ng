Ahead of the March 11, gubernatorial and state assembly elections, the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) has appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adhere strictly to the electoral Act 2022 to ensure electoral credibility in Nigeria. Chairman of the group, Auwal Ibrahim Musa (Rafsanjani), who made this known in a statement in Abuja, said electoral offenders of any kind must be punished under the laws of the country to dissuade others from perpetrating electoral offences in Nigeria. Rafsanjani noted that those caught in the act of openly intimidating and suppressing voters at polling units must be brought to book no matter how highly placed they are. He however noted that the impunity of the state governors during elections must be addressed through legal means to reduce their overbearing interference in elections. He added that the INEC must review all evidence of electoral malpractices presented before it. According to him, issue-based campaigns must take root in the political process in Nigeria rather than rely on identity mobilisation of voters. He said: “The place of debates must take legal place in the system to create room for healthy discussion and citizens’ accountability. “The EFCC And ICPC should continue with their good work to reduce the commercialisation of vote buying and arrest both the enablers, middlemen, and receivers during the upcoming elections. He further urged Nigerians to turn out in large numbers to elect their governors and lawmakers peacefully.
