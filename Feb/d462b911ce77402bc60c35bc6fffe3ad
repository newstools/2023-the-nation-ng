OJ Posharella, one of the cast of Real Housewives of Abuja has opined that the reality TV show has five strong personalities. In a recent chat with The Nation, OJ Posharella said she wants fans and viewers of the show to know that they are about to change the narrative that the Abuja edition is better than other franchises. “I want people to know that we have vibes, we have strong personalities. We have all sets of women. We can do fashion as well. We are intelligent, we are strong. We have it all going on because everyone you see how Lagos people are like, Abuja, that kind of just the same thing. We just changed the narrative, I guess,” she said. In the same vein, another member of the cast, Arafa said, “I think one thing I want people to take away would be never judge a book by its cover. Yeah, that’s the one thing. Never judge a book by its cover. People think Abuja is very mellow, low key. Especially going into this, a lot of people were like, oh, I don’t think Abuja has anything to offer, but we have a lot to offer. So basically, never judge a book by its cover.”
