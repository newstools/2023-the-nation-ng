The Lagos Branch of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) has held a walk in support of the second term bid of Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.  The walk, led by the body’s chairman, Olatutu Oladunni, attracted sports writers and enthusiasts.  It took off from Opebi through Opebi Link Bridge, Kudirat Abiola Way, Billings Way through to the Governor’s Office at Alausa. Speaking at the Governor’s office, Oladunni said the walk for support was necessary to canvass support for the incumbent governor of Lagos State, based on his overall performance, and particularly his endless support for sports and the Lagos SWAN. “We in Lagos SWAN deem it fit to hold this walk based on our conviction that the governor has done enough and deserves a second term. Be it in the area of education, infrastructure, sports and youth development, Governor Sanwo-Olu has done tremendously well. You can see this in his support for the Governor’s Cup, Oba Cup, Lagos City Access Bank Marathon and many more.  “As a body, it is important we do this to show our appreciation for his government’s support in helping us complete our beautiful secretariat at the National Stadium, Surulere, which people now look up to, unconditionally,” Oladunni said.
