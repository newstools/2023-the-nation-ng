An European Union Election Observer has commended the officials and ad hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the coordination of the 2023 presidential national assembly elections. Mr. Deleen Michel, the Team Leader of one of the EU observers, gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at the INEC collation Centre in Surulere, Lagos on Sunday. “My big respect goes to INEC officials. They have been able to manage the polling centres very well. “The young people of Nigeria who man the polling centres were warm. They did a great job,” he said. Michel also led his team to Oworonshoki area of Lagos on Saturday before coming to Surulere. Michel said his team did not experience any problems where they visited. NAN reports that the EU deployed about 100 observers to the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.
