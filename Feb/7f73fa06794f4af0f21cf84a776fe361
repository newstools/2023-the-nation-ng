Nollywood filmmaker and investor, Emeka Nwokocha of Dudubkack, has said that movie investment in Nigeria which is profitable can be risky if a proper investigation is not taken into consideration. The movie producer, who has produced a collection of 27 films for 10 investors between 2019 – 2023, said the future of the Nigerian film industry is huge and a medium for creatives to thrive. In a media parley during the weekend, while reflecting on the economic relevance of movie making, the serial entrepreneur who is also a member of the Producers’ Association of Nigeria (PAN) advised thatthough investing directly in a movie may sound glamorous but can be a complex and risky endeavour if care is not taken. He said: “Investing in movies can be lucrative and glamorous, but it is also a sophisticated and highly risky undertaking. Before investing in any movie project, be sure to do your due diligence and research the project, the producers, the talent, and the potential audience appeal, ”Nwokocha said.
