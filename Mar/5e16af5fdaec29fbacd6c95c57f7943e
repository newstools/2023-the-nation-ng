Following the decision to block his possible exit, the management of Everton have prioritised stepping up on talks over a new deal with Alex Iwobi and his representatives. According to The Athletic, Everton recently tied down Jordan Pickford to a new long-term contract, without a relegation release clause and they are looking at the long-term futures of some of their players and Iwobi is claimed to be next in line to receive a new deal. The club are planning to hold talks with the midfielderâ€™s representatives over a new contract to keep hold of the Nigerian ace. But the uncertainty over whether Everton will survive in the Premier League this season has complicated the process, however, the club are still keen to offer a new long-term deal to the Nigerian and tie him down at Goodison Park. The Super Eagles star has a year left on his contract at Everton in the summer and is believed to be happy at the club. It would be recalled that Everton dismissed speculation that Iwobi could be on his way to Turkey soon. There are indications that things could change dramatically if Everton are relegated but for the moment, offering a new contract to Iwobi is a priority for Everton.
