The governorship candidate of Accord in Oyo State Oloye Adebayo Adelabu has congratulated Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory at last Saturday’s presidential election. In a statement on Monday, Adelabu described Tinubu’s victory as ‘sweet’ and ‘deserving’, having worked assiduously to achieve victory in the hard fought electoral battle. “With this victory Nigeria can only be better for it. Because of his antecedent as an unrepentant democrat, we are convinced that Nigeria will soon take its rightful place in the comity of nation. “This is the first time in the history of our nation that a real dye-in- the-wool democrat will be taking up the mantle of leadership. “We expect good governance which we know Asiwaju is capable of providing considering his antecedent as former Governor of Lagos State and one of those who fought for the democracy we are enjoying today”. Adelabu enjoined the president- elect to seize the opportunity of his victory to reconcile the different sections of the country which have been fractioned by the activities leading up to the election. “It is a time to heal all wounds. It is also a time to reach out to the other candidates, for in every battle, a victor must emerge. For the sake of our country, it is important for him to reach out to his co-contestants who have also fought a good fight for therein lies the sweetness in his victory. Every hands must be on deck to take our country to a deserved height,” the statement reads.
