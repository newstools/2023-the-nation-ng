Napoli’s Victor Osimhen is believed to be on Manchester United’s shortlist after netting 20 goals and four assists in 24 games in all competitions this season, and former captain of the club, Rio Ferdinand believes it would be a smart move. He told BT Sport via Manchester Evening News: “I think if I was talking about investing and looking after my money, I’d probably go for Osimhen. There’s resale value with his age at 24 years old. It’s gonna be a huge outlay.” Osimhen joined Napoli from LOSC Lille in 2020 and has made 86 appearances in all competitions, scoring 48 goals with 13 assists. He boasts 15 goals and eight assists from 23 games for Nigeria too. Napoli paid €75m (£66.2m) to sign the 24-year-old and reportedly want in excess of €100m (£88.2m) this summer, so United would have to dig deep. They won’t be the only club after Osimhen with Chelsea and Liverpool credited with an interest, so there could be a bidding war in the coming months. Martial has scored a respectable six goals from 14 games across the board this season despite injury, but he hasn’t hit double figures for league goals in the last three years. Weghorst’s performances haven’t been too bad, but he’s spurned too many opportunities in the final third, so Ten Hag will likely upgrade the pair. United have a fervent need for a prolific center-forward, resulting in Aleksandar Mitrovic being suggested as a potential option, but Omishen would arguably be the better option.
