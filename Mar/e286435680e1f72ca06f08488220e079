Popular indigenous rapper Olamide has shared an incident that left him utterly pissed and embarrassed at the same time. The incident, he explained, happened many years ago when he was still under his one-time boss, ID Cabasa. Recounting the embarrassing moment, Baddo said: “I was in the studio when this senior artiste came in to record a song, and he said he was hungry. Who else will he send to buy food if not me who was the youngest in the studio? “The money he gave me was not enough for his meal, so I decided to add my own money. I even used my money to pay for transportation.

If he wants money, he should tell me and I will give him. He should not use a trick to steal my money. “I almost got angry, but one look from ID Cabasa calmed me down. Today, the guy is one of my biggest fans and he is planning to do a song with me.”
