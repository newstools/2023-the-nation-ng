Super Eagles striker Terem Moffi  is pleased  with  opening  his goals account  for his new French  Ligue 1 side, OGC Nice  after he grabbed a brace in the 3-0  away thrashing of AS Monaco in the high profile  Derby de la Côte d’Azur at the Stade Louis . Yesterday’s  game was  Moffi’s fourth appearance  for Nice since he completed  a deadline day transfer from Lorient FC  in the January  Window. But  in the Match day 25 encounter against  Monaco in the famous French Riviera , the 23-year-old Nigerian ace was in his best scoring element as he grabbed  the curtain  raiser in  the eighth minute as he latched  onto a long ball to finish past Alexander Nubel  for his first goal for Les Aiglons(The Eagles).  Thereafter, Moffi and French youth international midfielder  Khéphren Thuram-Ulien put up some scintillating shows  and it was the later that assisted the former for his second goal of the day  in the  26th minute. Moffi  would later assisted  Thuram-Ulien  for  Nice’s third goal barely  two minutes to the end of the first stanza of play. Yesterday’s brace was Moffi ‘s seventh  overall goal against Monaco  and  his 14th  in the on-going season after scoring an impressive 12  for Lorient  in the first half of the season  before crossing over to Nice. His performance  against  Monaco also fetched him the Man of the Match Award with a top rating of 9.2.  “It feels good not just to score my first goal for Nice ,” Moffi told NationSport  after the game. “But to make it two, providing the assist for the third goal makes it even sweeter.”
