NIGERIAN singer Bella Shmurda has opened up on his evolving music genre. In a chat with Dadaboy Ehiz on Apple Music 1, Bella Shmurda said he feels his music genre is too harsh for some folks, hence, he’s working on slowing it down to their taste. He said, “I just feel like people feel like my vibe is hard to combine. It’s not something you can just wake up in the morning and just want to vibe to. It’s not just a vibe, it’s something you have to think about, something that goes a long way.”  Continuing, Shmurda said, “Me personally I’ve been trying to calm it down with my vibes, because I really want people to vibe with me. I don’t want it to be too hard for people to vibe with me. There are important people in this music industry that don’t like it, they can’t do it so harsh. You can’t do it too harsh because they won’t follow.”
