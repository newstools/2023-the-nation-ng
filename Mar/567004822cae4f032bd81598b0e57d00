Dr. Sirajo promised that in line with Jaiz Bank’s principle of equity and fairness “the female staff would continue to be accorded utmost respect, support and a platform to achieve their career objectives”. The MD advised the ladies in the bank to “be proud of their gender and resist any form of abuse, intimidation and harassment”.
