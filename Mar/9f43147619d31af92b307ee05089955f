The Imo State Police Command has blamed pro-separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) for the burning of the residence of a candidate contesting for the state House of Assembly, Mr Ifeanyi  Odemelam, at Umuokparaocha village Umuolo Okigwe. .   Odemelam is running on the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Police spokesman Henry Okoye said yesterday that the hoodlums threw petrol bombs on the roof of the house, setting it ablaze.  The suspected “IPOB and  its armed militia ESN” members “escaped as the fire expanded into the building and razed it down,” he said  He added that a manhunt for the perpetrators was on.
