President-Elect Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has extended hands of friendship to all Nigerians, irrespective of their political affiliations, to work with him in building a greater country. He asked Nigerians to bury political and other divides to team up with him for a new nation. He spoke on Wednesday in Abuja after receiving his certificate of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) following his victory at last Saturday’s poll.  The former Lagos Governor noted after the rigours of the electioneering and politicking, it was time for all hands to be on deck for nation-building, insisting that politics must give way for nation-building. He pointed out that his victory should not be seen as personal, emphasising all Nigerians must undertake to be part of the task ahead.  According to him: “To you the people, especially the youths, I will work day and night. I will work to the utmost of my ability to make Nigeria better.     “For this to be a victory at all, it cannot simply be a victory for one man or even one party. It must become a victory for all Nigerians who are committed to a greater society.  “I know many did not vote for me. And you are disappointed that your candidate is not where I now stand. I understand your hurt. To you, I extend the embrace and comfort of one family member to another.  “This great project called Nigeria beckons to us all. It is bigger and more important than any partisan divide.”
