By Bukola Afolayan Group, the South  West Security Think Tank Forum  has called for calm and enjoins all citizens to eschew violence as the election results are being released. The Forum is appealing and impressing on all aggrieved youths in particular that elections are won and lost based on the aggregate of votes from all over the country and not in a few places where they have strong showing. It calls on those that feels aggrieved to wait until the final result is announced and act within the dictate of the Constitution by taking legal and legitimate steps to seek redress and not resort to violence or anarchy. The Forum cautioned that while some youths or citizens may have valid concerns to express, there are criminals and agents of destruction always waiting for such opportunity to loot and commit arson which will completely jeopardise the genuine concerns of citizens. The Forum warns that under no guise must the South West zone be turned to an epicentre of violence and arson as witnessed in the last Endsars protests. It should be noted that the South West especially Lagos State is yet to fully recover from the arson and wanton destruction of properties during the Endsars saga. Finally, the Forum calls on leaders of all the political parties to come out strongly to call their supporters to order, noting that they are all signatories to the peace accords before the elections.  Political leaders must be mindful of their utterances and also caution their supporters on the implications of violent actions and statements on our collective security.
