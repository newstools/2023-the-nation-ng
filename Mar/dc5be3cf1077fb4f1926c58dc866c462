Veteran actor Ojo Arowosafe aka Baba Fadeyi Oloro has died at 66. The thespian, who earned the name Fadeyi Oloro after starring in ‘Arelu’, a Yoruba TV series in the 80s, died on Tuesday evening after a long battle with kidney-related ailments. Popular comedian Woli Arole confirmed his demise in a post via his Instagram page. Arole stated: “So happy I reached out to you sir, so happy we played our part, so happy we laughed together, so happy we were able to show our support. “Rest in Peace the Legend “Fadeyi Oloro”. Let’s check up on people when dey are alive, Let’s show love when people can feel, Let’s help when it can be seen.” Last month, the movie icon, through his son in an Instagram live session with popular OAP Daddy Freeze, solicited the financial assistance of Nigerians after he was served a six-month eviction notice over unpaid rent. Subsequently, UK-based celebrity pastor, Tobi Adegboyega of Salvation Proclaimers Anointed Church, donated N3 million for Baba Fadeyi as he was fondly referred to for his treatment and other outstanding bills. Adegboyega further promised to continue taking care of ‘Baba’, appreciating the actor for all the great works he’d done to promote Nigeria and Africa. The late Baba Fadeyi Oloro was born on September 15, 1957 in Igbara Odo, Ekiti. He became renowned for antagonistic roles, accompanied by his prowess for incantation and signature herbalist character in the 80s’ and 90s’.
