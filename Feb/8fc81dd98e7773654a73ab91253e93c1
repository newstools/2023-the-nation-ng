The Result for the presidential election was presented to the INEC chairman, who is the Chief Returning Officer, by the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Health Sciences, Ila Orogun, Prof Akin Olawole Lasisi. The results, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, scored 210,494 to defeat 17 other candidates.

Prof Salami said elections in two polling units were cancelled for bypassing the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and over-voting. Responding to a question from the PDP agent, Senator Dino Melaye, Salami said: “We discovered that the number of accredited voters as contained in the BVAS was more that the number of votes cast leading to over voting and therefore, the result had to be cancelled.” The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Campbell Laing and the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard as well as the National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, witnessed the exercise.
