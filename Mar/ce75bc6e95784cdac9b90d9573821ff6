Operatives of the Nigerian Army have recovered a total of 1,671 Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and ballot papers from an apartment at Apapa, Lagos. The operatives attached to the 9 Brigade, Ikeja, also recovered cutlasses and wraps of marijuana in the apartment during a swift operation carried out yesterday afternoon. According to Commander 9 Brigade, Gen. Isang Akpaumontia, the apartment was raided following a tip-off. “Earlier today (yesterday) three young men were arrested with 1,671 PVCs. With the  support of the  Department of State Services (DSS), we were able to arrest them.  “They were arrested with some drugs, dagger, charms and over 1,000 PVCs. They were arrested at the Apapa general area, in a house where we traced them. “The owner of the house, who is  the prime suspect, was traced  to a hotel but he took off. We  are  going to hand these suspects and exhibits over  to our immediate headquarters  to do the needful because things have to be done the way they should, so as to discourage others who think they can  take laws into their hands and go scot-free,” said  Akpaumontia.”  The suspects, Seun, Toheeb and Kazeem denied having anything to do with the electoral materials, insisting they belonged to the fleeing owner of the apartment. Habeeb said: “The room they met us  belongs to our master. We were sleeping when some soldiers stormed the apartment.  We don’t know anything about PVC. This was our first time sleeping in that house”.
