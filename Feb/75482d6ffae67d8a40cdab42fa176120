The All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos West senatorial candidate, Dr. Idiat Adebule, has delivered her Polling Unit 029, Iba, Ojo, Lagos State Fire to the party’s Presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Adebule, who was declared winner in the unit for her senatorial election, also ensured she won the unit for the party’s House of Representatives’ candidate and Tinubu. In the senatorial election, she polled 127 votes leaving the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Segun Adewale, with 66 votes. In the House of Representatives, the APC got 114 votes while the Labour Party candidate came second with 103 votes. The former Lagos Deputy Governor completed the hat-trick in her unit with Tinubu winning the unit with 121 votes while Labour Party candidate Peter Obi got 120 votes. Adebule has been consistent in delivering her unit for the party despite the fact that the area is being dominated by the people of the eastern region who are more politically-conscious than their Yoruba hosts. She thanked the electorate and party faithful for the feat. According to her, there is need for voters to participate more in the electoral system. The Nation learnt that only 262 people voted out of 1,352 registered voters in the unit.
