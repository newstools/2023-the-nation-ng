Going by an eye witness account, an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) was yesterday razed by bandits who invaded Kimbi Village of Randagi Ward in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The APC, it was learnt belonged to the Police. There was, however, no official confirmation of the claim. A community leader in the area, Alhaji Yahaya Kimbi, claimed that bandits stormed his community early yesterday and attacked the APC. Kimbi told reporters in a chat that bandits, numbering about eight, stormed the village with AK 47 rifles carried out the attack. He said: “The attack happened on Monday morning around 1am and in the process, the hoodlums burnt the vehicle to ashes.  “However, the bandits did not kill or kidnap anyone during the attack. I think their only target was to destroy the Armoured Personnel Vehicle.” As at the time of filing the report, it was gathered that many people had fled the village for fear of the unknown. But the community leader said security agencies had visited the scene to take stock of the damage incurred as a result of the attack, saying, some residents were going about their daily activities.
