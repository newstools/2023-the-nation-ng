Nasarawa Governor, Abdullahi Sule has explained why the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) lost the presidential election to Labour Party(LP) in the State. Speaking during a media parley at the Government House Lafia, Sule denied internal wrangling as a result of the primaries were not the sole reasons for the loss. He said that the presidential election was actually between political parties against a movement. “The election was between political parties against a movement, it was difficult for political parties because they didn’t know where the movement was going but thank God that our candidate, Bola Tinubu won the election.” He expressed confidence that the forthcoming Governorship election will be different and APC will retain the State. According to him: “There are so many reasons why people lost elections but in our own case,what makes us great might contributed to us losing the election. One of the things that make Nasarawa great is the fact that, because of the proximity of the state to FCT, a lot of people from other parts of the country that probably do not share the sentiments of APC, and those people went against us.” Sule pointed out Lagos, Plateau, Kaduna and Kebbi without internal wranglings also lost the presidential poll. He told journalists that his administration has done a lot in different sectors such as security, revenue, education, employment of qualified teachers, agriculture, health and payment of regular salaries and pensions. He explained his administration has done much in the area of industrialisation, attracting Dangote company, Azman rice and Olarm rice among others.
