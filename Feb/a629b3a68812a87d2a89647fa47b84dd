A former member of the House of Representatives, Bamidele Faparusi, has commended the Appeal Court verdict that reaffirmed the victory of Biodun Oyebanji as Ekiti governor, on Tuesday, at the Ado Ekiti division. Congratulating the governor and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ado Ekiti on Friday, Faparusi called on Segun Oni to join hands with the governor towards the development of Ekiti State. The former governorship aspirant described the victory of Oyebanji at the appellate court as a major boost for Ekiti State, saying the development had been retarded by political instability and lack of continuity in government since the return of democracy in 1999. He noted that Oyebanji’s victory guarantees, for the first time, that the state would have continuity in government policy and development plans. “I want to congratulate Ekiti people, the APC, and of course the governor and his deputy for the victory at the Appeal court, it’s a victory for the people who willingly gave the mandate to governor Oyebanji. “Therefore, I want to appeal to Engr Segun Oni, having exercised his right to exploit judicial technical means to gain power and got the unfavorable verdicts at both the tribunal and appeal court, to accept the verdict in good faith and join hands with the governor to move the state forward, as a further attempt to Supreme Court will be tantamount to desperation and fraud,” he said.
