Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  in Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency of  Bayelsa State,  Michael Bless Olomu has rejected the  announcement of a Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP)  candidate  as the winner despite the declaration and cancellation of results by the returning officer, Dr Joseph Omoro. He raised the alarm over what he called  the violation of the electoral process by the government  in  flouting the Electoral Act. In a statement,  he noted that officials of the State Security Service, SSS in Sagbama witnessed the cancellation. ‘’The Government  has used everything at its  disposal to get the result declared whereas issues of BVAS irregularities like over voting, allowing voters to cast votes without accreditation and a lot of irreconcilable election results in some units in favour of the PDP, This is against the Electoral Act and guidelines for the 2023 general elections.
