When asked if the collaboration with Davido was the landmark point where things took off for him in his musical career, the 27-year-old  “Emo-Afrobeats” singer stated: “The collaboration with Davido was extremely important in my opinion because I feel like at that time, I needed a ‘cosign’, you know what I mean, from like someone who was very established. And Davido was more than happy to do that. “And you know… Yeah, we literally just met through that song and we kind of built a friendship from there. Not just with him but with his team as well. We all have a great relationship. “And I feel like that definitely played a huge role in my success and I’m always going to acknowledge that. And shoutout to Davido always.
