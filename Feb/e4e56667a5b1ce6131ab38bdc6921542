The other two parties are Action Alliance and the Africa Democratic Party. PDP Agent at the collation centre, Senator Dino Melaye said that from their computation of what has been presented, there is a perceived over voting as the figures were different from what was presented. He said “yesterday, we received results from Ekiti and we worked on it. The figure presented indicate that there were 301,558 accredited voters and out of that, the APC got 201, 494, the PDP got 89,554, leaving a balance of about 10,510. We were told that the Labour Party got 11, 397. “From our calculation, the figures does not tally and we believe that there is over voting and so, the results from Ekiti should not stand and the provisions of the law should apply.” The Labour Party and other parties agreed with the presentation by the PDP agent. But the Agent of the APC, Babatunde Ogala (SAN) said in accordance with the provisions of the law, once results have been declared, they right thing to do is to go through petition.
