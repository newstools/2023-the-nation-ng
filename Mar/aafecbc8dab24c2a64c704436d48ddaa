Afrobeats global star Wizkid has postponed his much-anticipated tour ‘More Love, Less Ego’ to Fall 2023 (September to November). Though he didn’t specify the reason, the superstar stated his decision was informed by unforeseen logistical circumstances. In November, 2022, the famous songster announced a 20-city tour for his latest project, “More Love, Less Ego”. He released the scheduled dates and cities for his North America, to run from March to April, 2023. Wiz was supposed to kick off on March 3 with a show at Toyota Centre in Houston, Texas, then take a run through 18 other North America cities on different dates with a climax of the tour on April 7, 2023 at The Kia Forum in Los Angeles, California. But in a recent post via his social media handles, the ‘Bad to Me’ crooner stated: “Due to unforeseen logistical circumstances the Wizkid-More Love, Less Ego Tour has been postponed to Fall 2023.  “All tickets purchased for the signally scheduled shows will be honored on the new dates at the respective venues. Stay tuned for more information.”
