Not a poet by accident    Overheard one morning from a soulful exchange) You are no poet by accident      For you didn’t wake up one morning To a medley of songs beneath your pillow      Begging for a place between your lips You are no poet by accident      For no riffs rushed down your rafter With you scampering around the room      Knowing not what to do with A sudden barrage of blessings      While a strange wind walloped the walls As the door creaked between its posts      Like a sentry with a half-open mouth You are no poet by accident      For the sun stood sky-centre The day you were born      The light which peeped between the curtains Was soft and blissfully bright.      Lyrical hands bathed you in singing water The household was one happy chorus      Of the anthem of your melodious arrival Calm clay cushioned your toddling steps      Gentle rains nurtured your tuneful leaps Your lullaby was love and lilting lilies      Ebony-born, with a song for every season.
