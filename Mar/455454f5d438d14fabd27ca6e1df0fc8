Nigerian singer and songwriter Godillac has affirmed that his recently released single ‘Gbera’ which features Terry Apala will become a global hit in no time. The Ondo State indigene expresses optimism over the new single produced by Daihard Beatz. He noted that the upbeat music has all the required elements to rule airwaves in Nigeria and beyond while also riding on the influence of the success of Afrobeats globally. “From the start of the song alone, you already know what’s about to hit your speaker. ‘Gbera’ is a tsunami in the music industry trust me and it will hit the global charts very soon,” said Godillac. “Gbera is my first single in 2023 and my expectations are high for the song. Fans are also ready showing massive love by streaming, you can tell by the number so far but I need more streaming and support from everyone. The goal is to make it a global hit which I am quite positive about. A big shout out to my bro Terry Apala for his contribution to this song.” On his plans for the rest of the year, Idan of Lagos, as he is fondly called said, “my fans should expect more hood music as usual. I’m also working on another Extended Play (EP) and subsequently an Album. I look forward to working with major people in the music industry. It’s gonna be a big year I promise, it’s no more business as usual.”
