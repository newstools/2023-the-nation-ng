Actor Ime Bishop Umoh aka Okon Lagos has illustrated the concept of disqualification by association using the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and the party’s House of Representatives candidate for Eti-Osa Federal Constituency, Olubankole Wellington aka Banky W. Following Banky W’s electoral loss to Labour Party’s Thaddeus Attah, Okon Lagos argued the fact that the singer associated with Atiku by contesting under same party cost him the house of reps seat which he very much deserved. He confessed to have felt a funny way when he saw campaign posters of Banky W posing side-by-side with the former vice president as though he were his running mate. The comic star however urged fans to pray against the syndrome of disqualification by association, adding the duo embodied the illustration perfectly. Sharing his thoughts via an Instagram post, Okon Lagos wrote: “In this ehn, pray to GOD that you don’t get to be disqualified by association, especially for a position you very much merit. BANKY and ATIKU is a perfect illustration! “The moment I saw posters of him posing side by side with Atiku as if he were Atiku’s running mate, I had a funny, funny feeling.”
