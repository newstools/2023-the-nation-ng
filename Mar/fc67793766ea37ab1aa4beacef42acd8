Power distribution has been halted completely in Imo State following the industrial action by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). The action was based on alleged militarisation and brutalisation of Congress members in the sitate. The development threw the State into total blackout on Thursday and Friday. The Head of Corporate Communications, Enugu Electricity Distribution Company PLC (EEDC), Emeka Ezeh, in a statement in Enugu confirmed the loss of supply experienced in Imo State was as a result of the industrial action by the organised labour union. “This led to the shutting down of our source of supply, leaving us with no energy to distribute. “As a result, all our customers in Imo State are without electricity supply. “We understand the inconveniences this situation will cause our customers, and we are hopeful that the issue will be resolved within the shortest possible time so we can restore supply to our customers. “We therefore appeal to our customers to be vigilant and ensure the electricity infrastructure serving them are not attacked by vandals who might want to take advantage of the situation to attack and vandalise electricity facilities. “We remain committed and working assiduously to deliver improved services,” he said.
