Two housemates of the ongoing BBTitans show have been evicted from the show. The evicted housemates are Juicy Jay and Olivia. And they became the fifth pair to be evicted on the show. They were both evicted on the seventh Sunday live show. Juicy Jay is a South African male housemate while Olivia is a female housemate and the two form the Juiovla pair. The pair was evicted on the seventh Sunday after spending a total of 49 days – seven weeks in the house. With the eviction of Juicy Jay and Olivia from the show, the dwindling numbers of the housemates have reduced from 24 to 12 after Sandra and SanTheo were first evicted in the second week. The two have been active in the house. Juicy Jay was known to have always been in the news for being the teddy bear and Yvonne’s man while Olivia has always given advice to other housemates. The Juiovla pair didn’t make it to become Heads of House till their eviction.
