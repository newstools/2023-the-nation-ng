The Presidential Election Court (PEC) in Abuja on Friday granted permission to the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP), Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi to inspect materials used for the February 25 election. A three-member panel presided over by Justice Joseph Ikyegh, granted the permission as sought in two separate motions ex-parte filed by Atiku and Obi. While Atiku filed his own on March 1, Obi’s motion was filed the next day.  They both have the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), President-elect, Bola Tinubu and his party, the Al Progressives Congress (APC) listed as respondents. Adedamola Falokun , who appeared for Atiku, moved his motion, while Alex Ejesieme (SAN) moved Obi’s motion, which the court granted. The court among others, ordered INEC to allow both applicants access to the materials used for the last presidential election. It also directed INEC and its officials to allow them to inspect the materials on a day-to-day basis.
