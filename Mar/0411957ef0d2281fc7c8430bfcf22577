The Lagos State Planks and Building Materials Market Sellers Association has reiterated its support for the re-election of Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat. At a stakeholders’ meeting in Amu Planks Market, Mushin, President of the association, Alhaji Lateef Adelodun, said it was expedient to re-elect Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat so that can complete the many development projects they started in 2019.’ Adelodun, who noted that Nigeria would thrive economically with good leaders, called on members of the association to spread the message of Sanwo-Olu’s re-election to all nooks and crannies of the state. He also urged other ethnicities to vote massively for Sanwo-Olu on Saturday because ‘we believe in one Lagos’. “Lagos, being the state of excellence and Africa’s commercial hub, is devoid of tribalism, nepotism, and religious sentiments. I urge everyone, including non-Yoruba, to vote for the best candidate that would give everyone an enabling environment to prosper,” he added. Adelodun also congratulated president-elect Asiwaju Bola Tinubu on his victory, describing it as ‘deserving and expected to turn around the fortunes of Nigerians who have clamored for good governance over the years’.
