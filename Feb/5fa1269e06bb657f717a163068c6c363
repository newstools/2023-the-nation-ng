The Founder of Oduwa Blockchain Solution, Bright Enabulele,  has  spoken on  the  hitches being experienced in the ongoing  elections in Nigeria, saying Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) adopted for the process, needs to be rejigged. Citing reports that BVAS failed some electorate, Enabulele said it wasn’t surprising, adding that the challenge is likely to be experienced in the future if human interference in elections are again allowed. His words: “We cannot have free and fair elections in Nigeria if the electoral process still depends on human interference. Hence,I propose a blockchain electoral solution for Nigeria and other countries in Africa. “In order for humanity and especially African countries to prosper, they need accountability, and accuracy in their electoral process.
