Napoli FC attacker, Victor Osimhen has called the current season the best of his career following his explosive stats for the Naples based team in Italy and European club competition. Osimhen has scored 21 goals from just 25 games in all competitions for Napoli this season with 19 coming from 20 Serie A games alone. He was on the scoresheet last weekend again for Napoli in their 2-0 victory at Empoli for his ninth consecutive Serie A goal. “This is definitely the best season of my career,” the 24-year-old reportedly said.“ I feel great mentally and physically and I hope to carry on like this to achieve even greater things.” The Nigeria international was immortalised in cake form by a local bakery in the Scampia area of Naples following an extraordinary start to this season. After images of the cake design went viral, the bakers decided to present the man himself with one of the special Osimhen items. “Our dream has come true!” assured the bakers as they handed it over through the car window. The chocolate cake is complete with a version of Osimhen’s trademark protective face mask and chopped roasted hazelnuts representing his bleached hair. Even if Napoli are 18 points clear at the top of the table, it’s safe to assume cake won’t be allowed by the club’s fitness and nutrition staff.
