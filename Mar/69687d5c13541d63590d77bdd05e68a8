Actress Lolade Okunsanya has shared a secret with guys, explaining some females they admire always decline their visit invitation. The ‘Ijakumo’ star suggested most ladies guys see and admire on social media look different in reality. She claimed they declined visit invitation from guys regardless of the love they’re being show because their beauty was being enhanced with the use of make-up and filter which they’re trying really hard to conceal from the guys so they don’t end up being ditched. Okunsanya said: “This other gender, you see all the girls that you actually like online, always video-calling her, chatting her, you’re sending her money, you like her but she says that she doesn’t want to see you. “You keep begging her to come around so you can see her and she keeps saying ‘dont worry later’. You continue sending her money because truthfully, you like her.  “Me I want to tell you one of the reasons they refuse to come is because…you see all those girls, most of them don’t want to come because they know that in real life, there’s no filter. “They don’t want to see you because, if they see you and small ‘ta ta ta’ happens, and they have to go to the bathroom and clean their face, that’s when you’ll see the koko and the big big pimples.  “That’s why mama does not want to see you. Because she knows that if you see her like that, you will not want to give her money again.  “So, this other gender, insist! Insist!! Insist!!!”
