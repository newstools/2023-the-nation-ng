Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar will miss the rest of the season as he undergoes surgery on his injured ankle, the French club announced yesterday. The Brazilian forward, who damaged his right ankle in the 4-3 Ligue 1 win against Lille last month, will have the surgery in the next few days and will be out of action for three to four months, PSG said.  “Neymar Jr has presented several episodes of instability of the right ankle in recent years,” PSG said in a statement. “Following his last sprain on February 20, the Paris Saint-Germain medical staff recommended a ligament repair operation to avoid a major risk of recurrence. All the experts consulted have confirmed this necessity.” The club said its medical staff “recommended a ligament repair operation” be undertaken in Doha. The news is a major blow to PSG’s Champions League hopes as they look to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit in the last 16 against Bayern Munich in Germany on Wednesday. Neymar, 31, has scored 18 goals for the French champions in all competitions so far this season but has only netted twice in the eight games he has played in since returning from the World Cup. The 31-year-old also injured his right ankle in Brazil’s opening match at the tournament in Qatar, but he was able to return later in the competition.
