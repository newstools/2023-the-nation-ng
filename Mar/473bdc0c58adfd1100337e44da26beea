Salernitana defender William Troost-Ekong is back on track after recovering from an injury sustained during a league match at Verona in mid-February. The player, who is a key figure for both his club and national team, fractured his tibia plateau, which resulted in him being sidelined for a few weeks. Troost-Ekong, who has been keeping fans updated on his progress through social media, recently posted a video of himself running again for the first time since the injury. According to Salerno Notizie, he expressed his joy and relief at being able to take this important step in his recovery. The defender is expected to return to competitive action after the international break at the end of March. However, this injury update means the Super Eagles vice-captain is a major doubt for Nigeria’s crucial Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying doubleheader against Guinea-Bissau on March 22nd and 28th. Nevertheless, his return to fitness is a significant boost for his club side, Salernitana, who are currently fighting to stay in Serie A. The Garnets sit two places and seven points above the relegation zone with 13 matches left in the 2022/2023 season. Troost-Ekong joined Salernitana during the winter transfer season after ending his stay at English side Watford. On his debut for the Italian club, Troost-Ekong impressed in a 2-1 win away to Lecce. Salernitana were, however, on the receiving end of a 3-0 trouncing in the hands of Juventus in Troost-Ekong’s second game. The former Udinese centre-back lasted 83 minutes in the 1-0 loss at Verona before he got injured and was replaced.
