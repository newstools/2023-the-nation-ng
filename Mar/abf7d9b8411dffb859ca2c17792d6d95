President-elect Asiwaju Bola Tinubu will build a country youths can be proud of but will need support, National Youth Mobilisation (Southwest) of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council (APC-PCC) has said. Its director, Kazeem Raji, in a statement, believes Tinubu, who he said has the capacity, experience and leadership skills, will address the concerns of the youths. He said: “This is no doubt a very hard-won victory and very sweet too, given all that our leader and President-elect had to go through from the primaries till his eventual victory at the poll. “Now that the election has been won and lost, the work ahead to build a greater Nigeria that we can all be proud of and bequeath to unborn generations remains the duty of all of us. “This is the more reason why those who couldn’t make it in this election should accept the olive branch extended by the President-elect. “The country belongs to all of us. We should, therefore, stay away from unpatriotic calls from some quarters who want to plunge the country into regrettable chaos. “Those who are still not happy with the outcome of the election can seek redress in a court of law as provided by the constitution.” The APC PCC youth team congratulated Tinubu on “the resounding victory recorded in last Saturday’s presidential polls”. “We thank Nigerians for going out peacefully to exercise their civic right during the election and for voting for Asiwaju Tinubu and his running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima. “Both have what it takes to renew the hope of Nigerians and make life much more comfortable for all,” the statement added.
