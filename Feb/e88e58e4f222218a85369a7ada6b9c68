PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated a 56-member national high-level Advisory Council (H-LAC) to support Nigerian women and girls in economic development. The H-LAC, according to a member of the committee, Dr Judith-Ann Walker, is significant and important, especially in the context of recent failed attempts to pass gender-focused laws to redress economic, political, and social imbalances against women and girls in the country. Inaugurated on the wings of the 2023 General Elections by President Muhammadu Buhari, and under the auspices of the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, the H-LAC is non-political and expected to cross over into the next administration. Dr Judith, who is the Executive Director of the development research and projects center (dRPC) and Coordinator of the PAWED project, disclosed that the committee has been set up to serve as a veritable bridge between administrations on key development issues affecting women and girls. Issues include girls’ education, technical and life skills as contained in the Adolescent Girls Initiatives for Learning and Empowerment, AGILE project; and women’s economic empowerment, as contained in Nigeria for Women Scale-up program. The current AGILE and NFWP projects, as well as new projects of the incoming administration will find policy backing in the soon-to-be-launched Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) national policy. She said: “The High-level Advisory Council seems set to emerge as Nigeria’s first multi-stakeholder, a non-political advisory body, bridging political administrations on an issue for which all Nigerians are united – ending poverty, vulnerability, and the struggles of Nigerian women and girls. With representation from key government MDAs in H-LAC and with the H-LAC Secretariat structured around an Inter-ministerial Working Group (IWG), the Council is well institutionalized within the government.”
