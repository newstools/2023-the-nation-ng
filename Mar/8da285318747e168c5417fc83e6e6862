The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it needs to reconfigure the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for the next round of elections. The commission stated that it would require sufficient time to reconfigure the BVAS needed to conduct the governorship and Houses of Assembly elections that will hold in the 36 states of the federation, except the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It explained that considering the number of BVAS required to conduct the election across states, INEC would need to reconfigure the BVAS to be used for the March 25 polls and deploy them to polling units across the country. INEC said its technical team has to be deployed on time to begin the reconfiguration of the devices. The commission urged the Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC) to vary the orders granted the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party (LP), Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, to inspect materials used for last presidential election. INEC, in a motion on notice filed on March 4, is praying the court to vary the order which restrained it from tampering with materials used for the elections. It prayed the court to vary the earlier orders in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act.
