SPOTIFY has unveiled features and tools to grow their 500+ million monthly active users and build their careers for artists, podcasters and creators. This was revealed at the Spotify’s second Stream On event which was held on Wednesday, March 8. The virtual event had music artists, songwriters, video and content creators, and podcasters from all over the world joining Spotify for a day of announcements, inspiring stories, and hands-on demos of new tools and resources coming to the global creator platform. “Stream On is about all the ways we are bringing Spotify to life and letting creators at all stages of their careers know that we are open for business. We are focused on building the best home for them – a place where they can establish a career, thrive and grow and where the world can be inspired by their creativity,” Spotify Founder & CEO Daniel Ek shared during the morning keynote presentation. He continued, “And that’s what we’ve been doing for almost 17 years: building, improving and reimagining this home to better meet creator needs and help them chart new pathways to success. As we look to the future, we are excited to expand that ambition to even more creators across new formats. We’re enabling more creativity, discovery and personalization than ever before by providing the best resources, support, and interactivity.”
