The Nigeria Football Fund (TNFF) Head of Media and Publicity, Andrew Ekejiuba, has expressed delight at the quality of the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) coverage by the country’s sporting media, calling on stakeholders to support the League by investing in the TNFF. According to him, the TNFF  project will facilitate sustainable liquidity in the football ecosystem and also provide attractive Returns on Investment (ROI) to investors. He noted that the ongoing abridge league has received heart-warming media coverage and thanked the sporting press for doing a great job. He said: “We are at a threshold of making history with the Nigeria Premier Football League following the massive media coverage given to our league by the sporting press at the ongoing 2022/2023 season and the positive restructuring that is quietly going on in the background as a result of the emergence of GTI into Nigeria’s football ecosystem. Thanks to the sporting press for the great job they are doing with the league coverage. “The introduction of TNFF by GTI has also brought a positive turnaround to the NPFL such that the issue of funding for our football league is no longer a problem. Clubs, FAs, match officials and NPFL staff can give testimony to the level of support and attention given by GTI in this regard,” Ekejiuba added. In the meantime, Ekejiuba has called on Corporate Nigeria and individuals who have an interest of Nigerian football at heart to invest in TNFF. “This is a clarion call to Corporate Nigeria and individuals who have passion and interest in our beautiful game’s development to key into the TNFF project now before foreign investors will take up the entire units offered by TNFF. Already the value of N1 per Unit at the Launch of the Fund has appreciated to N1.02 per unit which depicts a positive future for the League,” he counselled. He added that the second phase of the league which will commence on 25th  March will be quite thrilling.
