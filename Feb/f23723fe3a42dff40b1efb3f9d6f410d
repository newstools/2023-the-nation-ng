Catholic Priests on yesterdayÂ  saved a Supervisory Presiding Officer (SPA) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from being beaten up by youths for trying to stop voting in Enugu. The incident happened at polling unit 004, 005, 006 and 007 located at Bigard Memorial Seminary, Enugu. Trouble started when the SPO visited the polling units and asked the Presiding Officer (PO) to close voting around 4:30pm stressing that it was getting late.
