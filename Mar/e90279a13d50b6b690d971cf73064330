The Labour Party(LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi has alleged last Saturday’s poll was programmed to deliver pre-determined results. He said the election did not meet the necessary requirement and cannot be adjudged credible. The former Anambra Governor, who is addressing a world press conference in Abuja, said that Nigerians were robbed of their true choice. He insisted that he would pursue justice through court and was ready to challenge the results. “Labour party won the election and I will prove it,” Obi vowed.
