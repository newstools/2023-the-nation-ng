The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has denied endorsing the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. It said reports to that effect are fake and untrue. Addressing reporters, the chairman of the Kano chapter of ACF, Dr. Faruk Umar, said the report of any such endorsement was falsified to blackmail and confuse voters. He said: “I am addressing you today on an issue that was reported in the media suggesting that AREWA Consultative Forum, (ACF) has decided to support the presidential candidate of PDP. The statement is not true. ACF is not supporting any candidate.
