As Everton face another massive game this weekend against Brentford, one of their longest-standing players, Alex Iwobi, is still awaiting a new deal. There are rumours about a fresh contract for the former Arsenal man who first signed for the Blues’ in summer 2019. Iwobi’s Everton career has been a very disappointing series of mainly hugely underwhelming performances under a series of different managers. He has never found a level of real consistency apart from odd spells here and there. The Nigeria international was a very late signing that summer after the Toffees’ had been linked with a move for Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha. Iwobi’s true ability and even his best position in the team were a constant issue from the start of his time on Merseyside. His first manager was Marco Silva but he was gone six months later to be ultimately replaced by Carlo Ancelotti who left for Real Madrid and Rafa Benitez succeeded the Italian and brought in Demarai Gray and Andros Townsend to play in the wide attacking positions. Following Benitez’s sacking, Frank Lampard became the latest new manager to try and turn things around at Everton. He was Iwobi’s fourth manager in two and a half years. Lampard seemed to be the first Blues’ boss to get a decent tune out of the player as he moved him to a central midfield position where for a while he was putting in very solid performances. Since Lampard’s departure and Sean Dyche’s arrival, Iwobi’s form has dipped again and he hasn’t had the same impact after being moved back to a wide midfield role in the ex-Burnley manager’s 4-5-1 formation. Recently, rumours surfaced that Iwobi was perhaps ready to move on to pastures new but any such potential move was blocked by the club.
