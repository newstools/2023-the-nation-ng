After playing 1-1 draw against Auxerre at the weekend, OG Nice coach Didier Digard has promised to hand Terem Moffi more leading role in the attack. As Nice travel to Nantes this weekend, Digard is optimistic that Moffi will deliver when it matters. Speaking during a press conference after OGC Nice’s draw with Auxerre, Digard said: “We are working to build automatisms, of course. But I don’t necessarily need Terem Moffi  to do so because I have players around him who are very effective between the lines. I would prefer to see him in front of goal and to keep the opposition’s defence as deep as possible.  “Despite everything, he had a good opportunity at the start of the second half. Even if you don’t see him and then he scores, that would be fine for me. Of course, he is more comfortable with more space but given the situation he could have scored and the match would have been different,” the coach added. Nice occupy seventh place on the French Ligue 1 table with 42 points from 26 matches.
