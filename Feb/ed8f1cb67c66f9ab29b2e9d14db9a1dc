Super Eagles attacker Peter Oladeji Olayinka has stated that it would be a dream end to his career with Slavia Prague when the season ends if he is able to deliver double titles to the Czech Republic club. Olayinka will leave Slavia Prague by June 30th to Red Star of Serbia and the 27-year-old said shortly after his two goals helped them to a 2-0 win over Slovacko last weekend that his parting gift would be to ensure they win the league and the cup double. “Our goal is to win the double. That is the reward we look up to,” Olayinka told the club’s official website. “It is very important to us. I want to get these two trophies before I leave the club. I would be very happy indeed.” He said they were happy to return to winning ways after the draw at Teplice and the Eagles striker said he was thrilled that fans chanted his name as he was about to be substituted.
