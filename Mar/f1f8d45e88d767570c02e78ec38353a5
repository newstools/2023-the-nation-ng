Wikki Tourists’ Manu Garba has asserted that the Giant Elephants are looking forward to having an improved season as the second round of the 2023 Nigeria Premier Football League season resumes on March 26th. Wikki Tourists started the season poorly losing their opening three games before their first win of the season on Matchday six. It was a 1-0 home win over Rangers International which was a follow up to the home draw with Doma United. They also beat Lobi Stars and got a morale boosting 1-1 draw in Aba against Abia Warriors. They finished the first stanza in ninth spot with eight points from nine games and a not excited Garba told our correspondent that they have sat as a team and analysed what they did wrong in the first round to ensure they bounce back when the second round starts. “We have carefully analysed the table and the number of matches remaining in the second round and have challenged ourselves to go the extra mile to ensure we get to the top half of the table,” Garba said. Wikki Tourists will open the second stanza with a must win tie with Sunshine Stars at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium, Bauchi. They fell 1-0 to the Owena Whales in one of the Matchday 9 games played two weeks ago and they would be seeking a pound of flesh in this reverse fixture to salvage their season.
