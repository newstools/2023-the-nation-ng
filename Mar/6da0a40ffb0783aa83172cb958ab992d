The redesigned FIBA Women’s EuroBasket trophy was unveiled  yesterday, marking a new era for Europe’s flagship women’s basketball competition. Serbia legend and the FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2021 MVP Sonja Vasic was on hand to present the coveted prize at the FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2023 Draw in Slovenia. The sleek and elegant design seeks to provide the premium tournament a representation of its offer with a trophy that holds true to its traditions whilst emulating the values of the competition in contemporary way. Made from 16 unique cast shapes representing the number of teams, it comes together to form a blossoming flower-like symbol. With gold interior and silver exterior with hints of gold, it mirrors the men’s trophy in an elegant manner, strengthening the cohesion between the two competitions, and also holds a recognizable silhouette of its predecessor. “We are thrilled to reveal the new trophy today,” said FIBA Executive Director Europe Kamil Novak. “The FIBA Women’s EuroBasket is our flagship women’s basketball competition and the new striking design of the trophy reflects this perfectly. Women in basketball is one of the key strategic pillars for FIBA and this is part of our ongoing effort to promote the women’s game.” The re-design of FIBA’s trophies is part of the ongoing process of enhancing the brand and position of FIBA’s competitions, which began in 2017. The new trophy will be awarded for the first time at FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2023, taking place from June 15-25 this summer in Tel Aviv, Israel and Ljubljana, Slovenia.
