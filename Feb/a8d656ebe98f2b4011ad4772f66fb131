The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council (APC PCC) on Tuesday advised the presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party. (PDP) Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, Labour Party (LP) emulate former President Goodluck Jonathan by calling to congratulate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu before the official declaration. The Special Adviser Media, Public Affairs and Strategic Communications Dele Alake stated this on Tuesday in Abuja. He said the two presidential candidates should take the path of honour, having received details of the results from their agents at all levels of collation to call Tinubu ahead of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) formal declaration. “In 2015, President Jonathan did not wait for INEC to finish collation before he called President Muhammadu Buhari and congratulated him on the true spirit of democracy and sportsmanship. “We urge Atiku Abubakar and Obi to follow the same path of honour, instead of attempting to heat the polity via the reckless statements by surrogates. Let Atiku and Obi call Tinubu now.”
