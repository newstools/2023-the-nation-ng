Popular content creator Amarachi Amusi aka Ashmusy has claimed that she declined an offer of N20 million to endorse a particular politician for Saturday’s presidential election. The skit maker, who was recently accused with her colleague, Nonraj of having an affair with Dino Melaye, said this in an Instagram post. She said she was approached to make a political post in support of a candidate she and many others don’t want. Ashmusy confessed the offer was tempting albeit she rejected it because it would mean selling her soul to the devil.
