Manchester United ended their six-year trophy drought as they beat Newcastle 2-0 to win the Carabao Cup. Casemiro scored the opener for Erik ten Hag’s side at Wembley and they doubled their lead before the break via a Sven Botman own goal. It is their first piece of silverware since they won the Europa League under Jose Mourinho in 2017, and it could be the first trophy of a potential quadruple, with United still in the FA Cup, Europa League and still having an outside shot of winning the Premier League. Newcastle were bright in the early stages but it was Manchester United who took control on 33 minutes, as Casemiro rose to head home from Luke Shaw’s free-kick. There was a VAR check but the Brazilian was ruled to be narrowly onside. A Marcus Rashford shot deflected off the unfortunate Sven Botman to double Manchester United’s lead at Wembley Six minutes later the lead was doubled as Marcus Rashford combined brilliantly with Wout Weghorst before driving into the box and seeing his shot deflect off of Botman before evading Loris Karius in the Newcastle goal. Eddie Howe threw on Alexander Isak at half-time to try and help turn the tide, but Newcastle could not break down a stubborn and resilient red wall, as Man Utd saw out the win.
