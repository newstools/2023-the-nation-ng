Nigeria’s Flying Eagles yesterday recorded the first and most significant win at the ongoing U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Egypt 2023 after Solomon Agbalaka’s 71st minute handed the former champions a crucial win over host – Egypt. Also yesterday, Group A leader Senegal secured their place in the quarterfinal after their convincing 3-0 win over Mozambique to record their second win in the competition. Nigeria suffered a 1-0 defeat against Senegal in their group opener at the weekend. Still, the young Eagles recovered from the defeat hangover to beat Egypt in front of their home fans at the Cairo International Stadium. Despite playing goalless in the first half, the Nigerian side came out better in the second half making several incursions into the box of their host and their efforts paid off when defender Agbalaka nodded home from a cross to beat the Egyptian goalkeeper as well as broke the heart of the home fans. The Egyptians made several attempts to level up the match but the Nigerian stood between the goal to prevent them from levelling up. Even the added five minutes by the centre referee Jean Ishimwe could not prevent them from going down against Nigeria. Senegal were, however, flawless in their 3-0 hammering of Mozambique. Pape Diallo was the star of the match with his brace seeing off the Young Os Mambas while his namesake Pape Diop scored the third goal for the West African side. Host – Egypt now walk a tightrope going into the last group match as they face group leader Senegal while Nigeria will be hoping to take their morale-boosting win over Egypt to face Mozambique on Saturday,.
