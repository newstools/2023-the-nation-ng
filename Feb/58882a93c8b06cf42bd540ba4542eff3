The market located at the Post Office Area at the heart of Maiduguri metropolis, according to eyewitnesses, went into flames from 1.30 am. “From where I am standing at the post office here, I can still see thick smoke and flames from the market. Security operatives have condoned off the area and no one could have access to the market,” Adeyemi, an eyewitness told our correspondent on Monday. According to sources, it is not clear what ignited the fire but some said it will not be unconnected with an electricity spark.
