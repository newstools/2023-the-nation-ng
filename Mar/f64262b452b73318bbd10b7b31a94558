Gunmen on Saturday night killed a Pastor of the Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) Rev Musa Hyok with two of his only sons in the Ganawuri community of Riyom local Government area of Plateau. The incident, which occurred in the early hours of Sunday, was said to be a reprisal attack following the killing of three herders on Wednesday in Ganawuri. Youth leader of Ganawuri, Song Mura, who confirmed the development to reporters, said trouble started when some suspected kidnappers were arrested during the market day last Wednesday but later escaped in the hands of a Vigilante who were to keep them before the arrival of security operatives. According to Muru, the situation degenerated into an argument and later escalated to crisis leading to the death of three Fulani youths. He alleged despite several meetings and appeals for calm, some suspected herders still launched an attack on the innocent family who had nothing to do with the last Wednesdayâ€™s incident. Plateau Police spokesman DSP Alfred Alabo confirmed the incident and said the Command has commenced an investigation to unravel those behind the attack. The pastor and his two sons have since been buried amid tension in the entire Ganawuri community.
