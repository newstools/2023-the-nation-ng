The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has charged the Flying Eagles to put behind Monday’s semi-finals loss to The Gambia at the ongoing U-20 Africa Cup of Nation (AFCON) and focus on the World Cup. Dare gave the charge yesterday in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media, Toyin Ibitoye. He expressed regret over the team’s inability to play in the AFCON final but commended them for picking a World Cup ticket. “The Honourable Minister encouraged the boys. Everybody is disappointed we didn’t make it to the final but that is football for you. I believe they will redeem themselves by winning Friday’s third-place match. “Now we have to also focus on doing a lot better at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in Indonesia in May. “There is very little time left but I believe the coaches now know where their focus should be in improving the team,” the statement quoted Dare as saying. The Flying Eagles lost 0-1 to their Gambian counterparts in the second semi-finals of the ongoing Under-20 AFCON played at the Cairo International Stadium in Egypt on Monday. Having lost the encounter, the Nigerian team will now square up against Tunisia on Friday in the third-place match.
